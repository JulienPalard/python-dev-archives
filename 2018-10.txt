Subject: [Python-Dev] Communication channels
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGEj9voO4qGZNsr9p=QfSd4oZ0OEUsv0+3q9j-HKz1B9NQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Last months, new communication channels appear. This is just a
reminder that they exist:

* Zulip: https://python.zulipchat.com/ (exist since 1 year?)
* Discourse: http://discuss.python.org/ (I'm not sure if it's fully
official yet ;-))
* IRC: #python-dev on FreeNode, only for development *of* Python,
mostly to discuss bugs and pull requests
* Mailing lists: python-ideas, python-dev, etc.

Some core developers are also active on Twitter. Some ideas were first
discussed on Twitter. You may want to follow some of them. Incomplete
list of core devs that I follow:

* Barry Warsaw: https://twitter.com/pumpichank
* Brett Cannon: https://twitter.com/brettsky
* Guido van Rossum: https://twitter.com/gvanrossum
* ?ukasz Langa: https://twitter.com/llanga
* Mariatta: https://twitter.com/Mariatta
* Serhiy Storchaka: https://twitter.com/SerhiyStorchaka
* Yury Selivanov: https://twitter.com/1st1
* ... the full list is very long, and I'm too lazy to complete it :-)
Maybe someone has already a list more complete than mine.

I hope that I didn't miss an important communication channel :-)

Another one is GitHub (and the bug tracker, for that matter). For
example, I believe here is where the discussion took place that led to
the initial draft of PEP 582 re: recognizing a local __packages__
directory:
https://github.com/kushaldas/peps/pull/1

The PEP was posted here:
https://github.com/python/peps/pull/776
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/

To my knowledge it hasn't been discussed on python-dev yet.

Also, if you are trying to be complete, another communication channel
is in-person events and conferences, etc.

Right, there are two main events for CPython core developers which are
only in the US:

* Language Summit during Pycon US (one day)
* Sprint in September (one week)

It started on GitHub and then continued in person at the dev sprints.

Nope, I assume because there is no one to actually approve it so there's no
point it discussing it yet. :)

Subject: [Python-Dev] LDLAST variable in configure.ac
Message-ID: <a295bfb3-a102-947d-4c14-cdfa3259ff3a@felt.demon.nl>

Hi all,

Before I submit a patch to increase the default MAXDATA setting for AIX
when in 32-bit mode - I want to know if I can put this LDFLAG setting in
LDLAST, or if I should introduce a new AC_SUBST() variable (e.g.,
LDMAXDATA).

I have not looked yet, but I was thinking that MAYBE! LDLAST is intended
as a last resort variable that can be modified in Makefile.

Thanks!

Michael

+1

Anything more than an initial idea really should occur on an ML, 
tracker, or repo.

My intent is not to ask you to subscribe to everything. I just wanted
to list all communication channels and let you make your own choices.
In my case, I'm unable to follow Zulip chat. There are too many
communication channels for me :-)

Ah - as to why - and from school! (as so-called intuitive! rather desired!).

A test score goes from 5.5 to 6.0 - which becomes passing.

Oh, do I recall my children's frustrations when they had a X.4Y score -
that became X.0. Tears!

And too modest to add self to list of twitter accounts...
https://twitter.com/VictorStinner
Or did he deemed himself not worthy of beeing followed ?

I was tempted to do a joke based on "takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was
given"...

Much love for the time you take to list all those channels and reach out to
the community.

Dear core-devs,

I have some bad characteristics.

I can be extremely enthusiastic - and write too much. I have been trying
to not write - anything - worried that my enthusiasm is not matched by
yours, or worse was a reason to ignore my work to get AIX passing all tests.

FYI: since the end of July I have dedicated 16 to 24 hours of my free
time to get this done. All for Python; all in my freetime. My employer
does not care - I do, or did.

I am grateful to Martin Panter - who helped me graciously when I knew
absolutely nothing when I first got started; Victor was kind enough to
answer some emails and help me along but also clear that he has zero
interest in AIX and my questions were taking too much of his time.
Regretfully for me.

Again - Victor - thank you for your time. I appreciated the assistance
and feedback.

(Others have helped from time to time, my apologies for not naming you
specifically.)

I am, to put it lightly, extremely frustrated, at this point.

I am sorry, for myself obviously - but also for Python. Obviously, I am
doing it all wrong - as I see lots of other issues being picked up
immediately.

All volunteers need some level of recognition to keep moving on.

And, while you may not give a damn about anything other than Windows,
macos and/or Linux - there are other platforms that would like a stable
Python.

Sincerely,

Michael

I think you should just put it in LDFLAGS.

LDLAST looks vestigial from OSF/1 support and should probably be removed.

Okay, but what are you frustrated *about*?

???

Have the core devs decided to drop support for AIX? Have your patches 
been rejected or something? Please explain what the actual problem is.

Michael,

I can understand the frustration you feel:  you have been putting effort
into a labor of love geting Python support on AIX (back?) into shape, and
feel that your efforts are unappreciated, or worse, that they will be waste
d.

The key thing to realize about the various core developers (and the
broader Python and open source communities) is that their attention is a
heavily over-committed resource:  it isn't that folks here aren't
benevolent toward your efforts, but rather that each of them (us?) makes
decisions every day juggling which projects / tasks to give the minutes /
hours we have available.  In the common case, the "triage" involves
scrathing an itch:  this bug affects me / my work, that feature would
make my life / my employment simpler, etc.  Even where there are minutes
available, the "is reviewing this feasible for me?" question kicks in.

Because AIX is relatively narrow in the scope of folks it impacts, the
average, overcommitted developer is likely to see a bug report, or even a
pull request, which makes stuff build on AIX and say, "Hmm, I don't know
enough to evalute that one, I'll leave it to folks who do know (and by
implication, who have some skin in the game)."  Even for more
consumer-focused platforms, it has historically been harder to get
attention for bugs / patches which affect only a single platform (Windows
file locking semantics, or the Mac installer, etc.)

One key way to get past that hurdle is to slice the size of each "thing"
down as fine as possible:  e.g., a pull request adding a single "#ifdef
AIX" block to one file.  Anything more than a screenful of diff is likely
to trigger the "let someone else review it" pattern, whereas being able
to scan the patch at a glance lets even a non-itchy reviewer decide,
"well, at least it can't hurt anything, give it a shot."

Once you've gotten a number of those small patches merged, you will find
that you've built a relationship with the folks who have been reviewing
them, and that they are more likely to pass them, and to review larger
ones, at least in part because *you* will have learned more about what is
needed in terms of code style, documentation, test coverage, etc., and
*they* will have learned to trust your judgement.

I'm sorry it isn't easier,

Michael, this message looks encrypted on my end. For people without your public key, it's impossible to read. This was probably unintentional on your end. In either case I'd avoid encrypting messages that go to public mailing lists.

I have thought of writing an almost verbatim post w.r.t. my efforts to
get Cygwin re-supported (which was never officially un-supported
either).  Victor asked me to set up a buildbot for Cygwin as a
prerequisite to much else, which I have done [1].  But it has been
turning out broken build after broken build and is all but useless
since, even at the time of setting it up, I pointed out that there are
two major blocker issues [2] [3] that prevent an even
partially-working build.  Naoki Inada provided some review of the
first one a while ago, and while we had some (I think valid)
disagreement on how to proceed, I updated the issue description with a
checklist of issues he raised that need some clear direction on how
they should be resolved (since at least on some of them we disagreed).
I'd be happy to do pretty much whatever so long as I knew it was
meeting a core dev's requirements while also meeting my own
requirements.

Obviously I'm sympathetic to the limited time and attention of core
devs--I am a maintainer on several projects myself and I know how it
goes, and I have tried not to make too much of a fuss about it.  But
there's a chicken-egg problem in the specific area of platform
support, which feels a little different from just "I need my pet bug
fixed", for someone who is not already a core developer: In order to
make any progress on the issue we need at least one core dev who is
interested in the same platform.  But if we're the only ones willing
to do the work who know or care anything about that platform, how are
we supposed to progress in the first place?

I, like Michael Felt, have a number of fixes waiting in the wings but
can't really progress until a little bit of bare minimum ground work
is at least done to get us up and running.

Michael, if there are any PRs you want to point me to that I might be
able to help review please do.  I don't know anything about AIX either
and am not a core dev so I can't have a final say.  But I've been
hacking on CPython for a long time anyways, and might be able to help
at least with some initial review.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Maintaining civility - the core of the Python community
Message-ID: <CAFQvZEP9198jVULau3V3S+FnJZFdOXTdbrLCdS68dpAOOXo7WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

You all have probably noted that there have been some contentious threads
recently, ultimately ending in a few people being given a time-out from
posting on these lists.

I don't normally get into things on this list, but it has been generally
discouraging to see a bunch of generally nice and reasonable people get
sidetracked into unproductive, sarcastic, and unhelpful remarks. There are
some efforts underway to formalize what is in and out of bounds - but I
would suggest that we are losing our way when we need to get to explicit
lists of things not to do.

Unfortunately, we are getting there.

I would like to reemphasize that we are bound together by the things that
we share. We love working on Python. We love being in the community and
seeing it grow. We can make our community stronger and more pleasant by
choosing to emphasize the things that we have in common and by ignoring or
avoiding topics that are more likely to generate unproductive discussion.

We can and should also try to remember that not everyone is coming from the
same place, and so we should actively assume the best of others and
interpret what they say in the most charitable way possible. Think of it as
Postel's law [1] as applied to people.

I'd also suggest that generally, 1) use of profanity, 2) use of sexual
terms and imagery, and 3) use of specifically denigrating terms to refer to
a person [2][3][4] are completely out of bounds for the professional
environment we want to maintain. It is ok to attack arguments, and ideas,
but ad hominem arguments - those attack a person, rather than the person's
argument - are also inappropriate. Use of sarcasm should be strongly
moderated, as it is not correctly interpreted by many people.

No reply is needed to this email. Instead, I'd prefer to see a continuation
of solid technical discussion, rather than meta-discussion.

Thanks,
Van

This change is fully compatible with 3rd party extensions.
The current change to InitType2 is only refactoring, there is no logic change there so that API remains unchanged.
Also, there should not be any instances of PyStructSequence_NewType in use. Any usage of this API causes a crash. A quick Google and Github search show that this is true. Thus, modifying this function should have no conflicts.

A more interesting question would be: "Is the migration of PyStructSequence_InitType2 to PyStructSequence_NewType backwards-compatible?" The answer is yes!

Using gevent as an example (https://github.com/gevent/gevent). This library has a dependency on StatResultType from cpython/Modules/posixmodule.c. This type gets initialized with PyStructSequence_InitType2. After modifying posixmodule.c to use NewType instead of InitType2 gevent still builds and passes all tests. Example: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9665

Thus, this change is backwards-compatible by itself and even after migrating to the NewType C-API.

I agree that this change is standalone and should go in by itself. Yet, I'm open to whatever people thing might be the right approach to get this in. i.e: Have more people look at it, writing a PEP, etc.

A little trick I learned:
https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Aaixtools+sort%3Aupdated-desc
lists them all.

What "flipped my switch" yesterday was discovering a PR that I was
gifted (by an ex? core-dev) and put in the system back in January is now
broken by a patch merged about two weeks ago. Worse, pieces of
test_ctypes(bitfields) that previously worked when using __xlc__ seem to
be broken. Which highlighted the "time pressure" of getting tests to
pass so that regressions can be seen.

If you let me know what info you would need (I gave lots of debug info
two years ago to get that initial fix).

And, I guess the other "larger" change re: test_distutils. Also, some
issues specific to xlc being different from gcc.

Those two do not show on the gccfarm buildbot.

Many thanks for the offer! I'll try to not take more than the hand offered!

I was wanting to avoid that, as LDFLAGS is an environmental variable.

At the surface, it appears Python is using PY_LDFLAGS (with
CONFIGURE_LDFLAGS coming from LDFLAGS during the ./configure moment.

A reason for a separate variable is that this particular option is only
relevant for the python EXE, and not for shared libraries and "other
things". IMHO, a reason for LDMAXDATA is because LDLAST is actually
already too widely used:

You two might collaborate with each other to the extent of reviewing 
some of each other's PRs.  That still leaves the issue of merging.

Since adhoc is not working to get merges, I had this same suggestion. 
Michael and Erik, I presume you have gotten some guidelines on what 
modifications to C code might be accepted, and what concerns people have.

I think for tests, a separate test_aix.py might be a good idea for 
aix-only tests, while modification of other tests might be limited to 
adding skips.  The idea would be to make it easy to remove aix stuff in 
the future if it again became unsupported.  Ditto for other specialized 
platforms.

Might be difficult. We both, or at least I, claim ignorance of the
others platform. I still have a lot of PEP to learn, and my idea of a
bug-fix (for Python2) was seen by core-dev as a feature change. I would
not feel comfortable trying to mentor someone in things PEP, etc..
> That still leaves the issue of merging.
How much confidence is there in all the "CI" tests? Does that not offer
sufficient confidence for a core-dev to press merge.
How about "master" continuing to be what it is, but insert a new
"pre-master" branch that the buildbots actually test on (e.g., what is
now the 3.X) and have a 3.8 buildbot - for what is now the "master".

PR would still be done based on master, but an "initial" merge would be
via the pre-master aka 3.X buildbot tests.

How "friendly" git is - that it not become such a workload to keep it
clean - I cannot say. Still learning to use git. Better, but still do
not want to assume it would be easy.

My hope is that it would make it easier to consider a "merge" step that
gets all the buildbots involved for even broader CI tests.

imho: guidelines - paraphrased - as little as possible :)

I have many assumptions, and one of those is that my assumptions are
probably incorrect.
Goal: have AIX recognized as a Stable platform, even if not in the
highest supported category.
And that implies, support as far as I am able, to keep it "Stable".

Unclear to me how this would work. Too young in Python I guess (or just
a very old dog), but what test would be needed for AIX, or any other
platform, that would not need to be tested in some fashion for the
'other' platforms. At a hunch, where there are many platform.system()
dependencies expected (e.g., test_posix, maybe doing something in the
class definition (is there a "Root" Object/Class that all inherit from.
Maybe a (read-only) "root" attribute (or is property better?) could be
the value of platform.system(), and iirc, might be used by as @property
in unittest. (so, if not in "root" class, then in something like
unittest/__init__.py.

I hope to be "close" in "Python thinking" - enough that someone who
actually knows how the pieces fit together could come with a better, and
more appropriate guideline/implementation.

> , while modification of other tests might be limited to adding skips.?

IMHO: IBM and AIX do not mention it, but for openstack cloudmanagement
(very specifically cloud-init) AIX needs a recognized stable Python
implementation. I am "surprised" in the level of communication of IBM
with Python community.

Personally, I do not see AIX as a specialized platform. Feels more like
the "last-standing" fully supported (commercial OEM) 'POSIX-UNIX'. Of
course my focus is narrow - so maybe there is a lot of support for
commercial platforms such as HPUX, Solaris, and other mainstream UNIXes.
Feel free to correct me!!

I'm not sure that's the case.  There are a lot of PRs or bugs that
sit there without getting reviews.  The problem is that few (or no)
core developers get paid to work on Python.  So, the time they spend
is motivated by their specific "itch".  Getting reviews on any PR is
difficult, even for core developers.  In their case, they have to
option of forcing the issue, I guess.

This is a problem we should try to deal with somehow.  Turning off
valuable contributors like you is bad.  I'm not sure how to do it
though.  At the core Python sprint in September there was some talk
about how CPython developers might get funding.  Maybe that could
help deal with the backlog of reviews required.

There is probably some truth in not caring about other platforms.
The problem from the reviewer perspective is the question of "what
is the potential downsides of this PR vs what are the benefits?".
The safest thing is to not approve the PR.  No core developer wants
to be the person who broke CPython.  You must admit, AIX is an
extremely niche platform at this point.  I bet if you picked 1000
software developers at random, it would be likely that zero of them
have ever used AIX.  So, it's not that we don't care at all about
AIX but that the cost/benefit equation makes accepting AIX specific
changes more difficult.

One specific suggestion I have about your PR is to try to make your
changes not AIX specific.  Or at least, make the AIX checking as
localized as possible.  So, as an example, in test_uuid you have:

    _notAIX = not sys.platform.startswith("aix")

then later in the module you check that flag.  While that is the
most direct approach to fixing the issue and making the test pass,
it is not good for the long term maintainability of the code.  You
end up with boolean flags like _notAIX spread about the logic.  Over
time, code like that becomes a nightmare to maintain.

Instead, I would suggest test_uuid is making platform specific
assumptions that are not true on AIX and possibly other platforms.
So, do something like:

    
    _IS_AIX = sys.platform.startswith("aix")

    _HAVE_MACADDR = (os.name == 'posix' and not _IS_AIX)

    @unittest.skipUnless(_HAVE_MACADDR, 'requires Posix with macaddr')
    def test_arp_getnode(self):
        ...

The _HAVE_MACADDR test is relatively simple and clear, does this
platform have this capability.  Later in the code, a check for
_HAVE_MACADDR is also quite clear.  If someone comes along with
another platform that doesn't support macaddr, they only have to
change one line of code.

This kind of capability checking is similar to what happened with
web browsers.  In that case, people discovered that checking the
User Agent header was a bad idea.  Instead, you should probe for
specific functionality and not assume based on browser IDs.  For the
macaddr case, is there some way to you probe the arp command to see
if supports macaddr?  That way your test doesn't have to include any
AIX specific check at all.  Further, it would have some hope of
working on platforms other than AIX that also don't support macaddr
but are POSIX and have 'arp'.  The code could be something like:

_HAVE_MACADDR = False
if os.name == 'posix':
    if <check arp to see if it supports macaddr>:
        _HAVE_MACADDR = True

Hope that is helpful.

  Neil

Partial reviews, short of accept/change are better than no review and 
can make a merge decision easier for a core dev.  You should each be or 
become familiar with PEP 7 and somewhat familiar with local C idioms. 
Do names follow local standards.  Do C-API calls make sense.

Failures of current tests would seem to me to be bugs.  However, some 
bug fixes require a feature change.  It is an awkward situation.  We are 
increasingly reluctant to patch 2.7.

Code for new features or bugs that escaped the tests should have new 
tests.  AIX-specific code should (as in must ;-) be tested before being 
submitted, since it will not be properly tested by CI.  With CI now 
covering Windows twice, Linux twice, and Mac, I believe it has become 
rarer for buildbots to fail after CI passes.  Victor would know.

I  believe that you are initially dealing with bugs that do not pass 
current tests.

Too complicated.

I considered the wider buildbot fleet to be post-merge CI ;-).

I would be for the purposes of said platform maintenance.  I believe I
already have some maintainer permissions on bpo for exactly this
reason.

That said, while I'm sure it would help, I'm not exactly sure what it
would solve either.  I believe strongly in code review, and just
having a "core developer" status does not necessarily free one from
responsibility for obtaining code review.

It also partly depends on the issue.  If it's a change that touches
other parts of the code in ways that could impact it beyond the narrow
scope of platform support, I believe it definitely should get a second
pair of eyes.  Unfortunately many of the outstanding patches I have
for review fall in that category.  Though in the future there will be
fewer like that.  The majority of work needed for Cygwin, at least, is
tweaking some areas of the tests that make assumptions that don't
necessarily hold on that platform.*

Thanks,
E


* For example, there are some tests that assume there is a user with
UID 0.  While UID 0 is reserved for a "superuser", I don't know that
there's any requirement that such a user *must* exist (on Cygwin it
does not :)

Yes, that can certainly happen.  I have many PRs floating around on
different projects that, you know, get stalled for months and months
and inevitably break.  It's extremely frustrating, but we've all been

I also about to ask if you have a buildbot for AIX, and I see now you
have several. So step in the right direction!

Hello,

I would like to propose Petr Viktorin as BDFL-Delegate for PEP 580, 
titled "The C call protocol". He has co-authored several PEPs (PEP 394, 
PEP 489, PEP 534, PEP 547, PEP 573), several of which involve extension

Petr has agreed to become BDFL-Delegate for PEP 580 if asked. Also 
Antoine Pitrou, INADA Naoki and Nick Coghlan have approved Petr being 
BDFL-Delegate.

I am well aware of the current governance issues, but several people

Really?
I don't know process to assign BDFL-delegate without BDFL.


This PEP is mainly for third party tools.
I want to get much feedback from them before new APIs become stable (e.g.
3.8b1)

So I want this PEP is approved (or
Provisionally Accepted) and reference implementation is merged as fast as
possible.

My understand is that accepting *any* PEP by anyone is out of the question until the governance situation gets resolved. That's the only reason why PEP 544 is not yet accepted for example.

AFAIU, there is not yet a documented process for BDFL-delegate assignment.

There's this in the devguide; which links to PEP1:

"20.2. PEP Process?"
https://devguide.python.org/langchanges/#pep-process
https://github.com/python/devguide/blob/master/langchanges.rst


And PEP 1:

"PEP 1 -- PEP Purpose and Guidelines"
  "PEP Workflow"
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#pep-workflow
  "PEP Editors"
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#pep-editors
  "PEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow"
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#pep-editor-responsibilities-workflow

https://github.com/python/peps/blob/master/pep-0001.txt

And the devguide has a list of experts:
https://devguide.python.org/experts/


Maybe PEP1 is the place to list current BDFL-Delegates
(in addition to in the PEP metadata as in the OT PR:
python/peps#797
"PEP 580: Petr Viktorin as BDFL-Delegate"
)?


Not to bikeshed, but is BDFL-Delegate still the current term because that's
what's in all the other PEPs' metadata?

PEP 1 says:

"""
However, whenever a new PEP is put forward, any core developer that
believes they are suitably experienced to make the final decision on
that PEP may offer to serve as the BDFL's delegate (or "PEP czar") for
that PEP. If their self-nomination is accepted by the other core
developers and the BDFL, then they will have the authority to approve
(or reject) that PEP.
"""

I know that it says "core developers and the BDFL". However, if the core
developers agree that Petr can become BDFL-Delegate, I don't see why
that wouldn't be possible.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Should assert continue to do a LOAD_GLOBAL on
 AssertionError?
Message-ID: <20181003155937.GM21220@ando.pearwood.info>

On the bug tracker, there's a discussion about the current behaviour of 
the assert statement, where shadowing AssertionError will change the 
behaviour of the assertion.

https://bugs.python.org/issue34880

Currently, assert does a LOAD_GLOBAL on AssertionError, which means if 
you shadow the name, you get a different exception. This behaviour goes 
back to Python 1.5.

I'm looking for guidance here, is this the intended behaviour, or an 
accident? Should it be changed to better match other builtins?

(For example, shadowing iter doesn't effect for loops.)


Thanks,


Steve

Did you actually try to get PEP 544 accepted or to appoint a 
BDFL-Delegate? I don't find any discussions about PEP 544 after the 
stepping down of the BDFL.

The process for PEP 544 is off-topic for that thread so I'm starting a new
one.

I have promised its author to approve it after certain minor changes (that
we both agree on) have been made. It's not an example of how PEP acceptance
in general will works until governance is sorted out though -- PEP 544 is a
very unique special case. (For one, it's uncontroversial -- the reason it's
not been accepted yet is that its author is busy with other things.)

Correct.  It?s entirely possible that the different governance models will have different ways to pick delegates.

Some are quite simple to fix, even if hard to find: such as:
"elif cmd is None:" -> "elif notcmd orcmd is None:"

Some are not bugs at all - very hard to find! Instead, "textual"
differences because a library is overly optimized - the expected
exception occurs - but no error message. Linking with a less optimized
(libssl.a and libcrypto.a) resolved many reported test "failures".

Nearly three years ago I was keen to see things in Python2(.7), but not
so much now. I also feel the time is to push hard towards current
Python3 versions.

I am dealing with tests that do not pass. The dilemma: what is wrong -
the test, or what it is testing? Generally speaking, I cannot call
Python3 (master) broken. So I look for a "root cause" in a test
assumption that is wrong, and find a way to correct that.

Sometimes, it is a bit of both - and those are very hard to resolve
without feedback.

See the discussion, elsewhere, regarding MACADDR. It has never been that
platform Y does not have a MACADDR - rather, platform Y formats it
differently than (all) other platforms.

Feels like an accident to me. Generally syntactic constructs should be
unaffected by what's in any namespace except when the override is
intentional (e.g. __import__).

Nods. However - this is a chicken/egg issue (imho). AIX is seen a weak
platform because noone has ever tackled these. When I started on this I
had never expected to have found a resolution to them all.

Platforms have differences and when the tests miss that difference that
the tests give a false result. e.g., one accepted PR was because AIX
libc printf() output for printf(NULL) is "" while other platforms output
"(null)".

a) I thought/hoped this was better practice and performance - calling?
sys.platform.startswith("aix")only once, rather than X times.
b) more maintainable (e.g., change to not platform.system()
c) iirc - this got changed to AIX = ...., and throughout the test is "if
not AIX"...

I suppose if someone had written the original test with "check program
to see if ..." it would have worked already.
I am trying to get current tests to work with minimal changes.

I am certainly not "blaming" anyone for not knowing this unique behavior
of this platform. Before debugging this I did not know of the difference
either. I agree that wherever a generic resolution is possible - it
should be done. However, as an "outsider" I do not feel empowered enough
to propose such a change to existing (and well proven for other
platforms) tests.

That's probably why we should call it "PEP-delegate" :-)

Consensus would obviously work (if no-one opposes the proposed person,
then surely we don't need an elaborate governance model to decree that
said person can become the PEP delegate, no?).

I would make it an implementation detail myself, i.e. any

To me, three experienced core devs approving of a 4th person as 
PEP-examiner is sufficient to proceed on a CPython implementation 
proposal.  I don't think we need to be paralyzed on this.  And indeed, 
when it comes to sub-PEP C-API changes, we seem not to be.  This change, 
if made, should be early in the cycle for the next version, rather than 
landing just before the first beta.

A language syntax-change proposal would be something else.

IMO changes to the C API should be taken just as seriously -- the potential
for breaking the world is just about the same (since most serious Python
applications use C extensions that risk breaking).

I agree.  My observation is that PEP-delegates have taken their 
responsibility *very* seriously, and I think that the evidence is that 
Petr would.  If you think otherwise, please explain.  On reason for a 
serious examination to start now is to allow adequate time.

The difference I was referring to is the philosophical basis of and 
technical evaluation skill needed for a decision.  I feel competent to 
opine on syntax proposals, but not on technical details of CPyython 
calls.  Moreover, as long as an internal change does not break anything, 
and at least does not hinder writing C extensions, I have little reason 
to care, whereas syntax changes will affect me, even if they are 'good' 
changes.

Hi guys -

The solution to "lazily initialize" an expensive object in the worker
process (i.e. via @lru_cache) is a great solution (that I must admit I did
not think of). Additionally, in the second use case of "*passing a large
object to each worker process*", I also agree with your suggestion to
"shelter functions in a different module to avoid exposure to globals" as a
good solution if one is wary of globals.

That said, I still think "*passing a large object from parent process to
worker processes*" should be easier when using Pool. Would either of you be
open to something like the following?

           def func(x, big_cache=None):
               return big_cache[x]

           big_cache =  { str(k): k for k in range(10000) }

           ls = [ i for i in range(1000) ]

with Pool(func_kwargs={"big_cache": big_cache}) as pool:

    pool.map(func, ls)


It's a much cleaner interface (which presumably requires a more difficult
implementation) than my initial proposal. This also reads a lot better than
the "initializer + global" recipe (clear flow of data), and is less
constraining than the "define globals in parent" recipe. Most importantly,
when taking sequential code and parallelizing via Pool.map, this does not
force the user to re-implement "func" such that it consumes a global
(rather than a kwarg). It allows "func" to be used elsewhere (i.e. in the
parent process, from a different module, testing w/o globals, etc...)..

This would essentially be an efficient implementation of Pool.starmap(),
where kwargs are static, and passed to each application of "func" over our
iterable.

Thoughts?

The behavior certainly has been relied on historically by py.test. By replacing builtins.AssertionError, you can improve the error message of the AssertionError by, e.g., inspecting the failing frame. py.test's code to do this was deleted in 2016, but other code bases may still be relying on this hack. It's probably okay to change the behavior in 3.8 with the understanding that a revert may be necessary if some clever hack surfaces.

I was figuring we could treat it as a caretaker mode governance: anything
we do before the new governance model is formalised is subject to
ratification by the new council members (or the new BDFL if that option
ends up being chosen).

In this case, I'd consider it unlikely for either the PEP delegate
appointment or any decisions about the PEP itself to be overturned - while
it's a complex topic that definitely needs to go through the PEP process in
order to work out the technical details, it isn't especially controversial
in its own right (the most controversial aspect is whether it needs a new C
level slot or not, and the PEP should clearly lay out the pros and cons of
that)

Cheers,
Nick.

And how does that affect *today*'s decision? The new governance model 
will only take effect 1 January (assuming that everything goes as planned).

As long as there is no new governance model yet, can't we just continue 
the PEP 1 process which has worked for many years? I know that we cannot 
literally apply PEP 1 because there is no BDFL, but we can certainly 
continue the spirit of PEP 1 if the other core developers agree with the 
BDFL-Delegate.

Of course we are taking this seriously. I want this to be taken as 
seriously as any other PEP and any other BDFL-Delegate appointment in 
the past.

To be clear: I'm not trying to rush my PEP though. It has been discussed 
and I have made changes to it based on comments. In fact, this is the 
second PEP with the same subject, I withdrew the first one, PEP 575. At 
some point in the past I asked one person to become BDFL-Delegate but he 
did not answer. And now recently Petr Viktorin made some insightful 
comments on it, so I asked him and he agreed.

Hi,

If IBM wants a better Python support, it would help a lot if IBM pays for
this development. With money, you can easily find core dev contractors.
Antoine Pitrou has been paid in the past to enhance Python support in
Solaris and it worked well.

Hello,
I don't think it's formally possible to do that now, but the following 
from elsewhere in the thread does make sense:

Antoine Pitrou:
> Consensus would obviously work (if no-one opposes the proposed person,
> then surely we don't need an elaborate governance model to decree that
> said person can become the PEP delegate, no?).

Yes, it would feel very silly to have consensus and not be able to act 
on it. But without a governance (and approval process) it's hard to 
*ensure* we have consensus where all relevant voices have been heard.

On the other hand, I don't agree with Nick Coghlan here:
> In this case, I'd consider it unlikely for either the PEP delegate appointment or any decisions about the PEP itself to be overturned - while it's a complex topic that definitely needs to go through the PEP process in order to work out the technical details, it isn't especially controversial in its own right (the most controversial aspect is whether it needs a new C level slot or not, and the PEP should clearly lay out the pros and cons of that)

PEP 580 *is* controversial -- there's the competing PEP 576 by Mark 
Shannon, who hasn't commented on this recently. Either would be an 
improvement, but choosing between them is a hard trade-off.
I'll leave technical stuff to another thread and concentrate on the 
process here.

When I'm happy with the PEP *and* if Mark says he's OK with it, I'll 
post a summary to Python-dev & Discourse with a special focus on the 
cons (e.g. the size increase of classes, which will affect everyone). If 
there are no "-1"s on the PEP itself or on the way it's discussed, let's 
treat PEP 580 as *provisionally* accepted, to be reverted if the new 
governance doesn't ratify it.

If there is no consensus, we'll need to wait for the new governance to 
decide.

Michael explicitly said this is a personal effort. IBM or other big 
money is not involved.

Is paying the best way to get features into Python? Does becoming a core 
dev mean you can now get paid for approving changes? Some of the 
implications are quite disturbing :(

Subject: [Python-Dev] AIX to stable, what does that take?
Message-ID: <5cdbb644-4f1d-46a7-de0c-80beebb0822d@felt.demon.nl>

In the buildbots AIX is marked as "unstable"? What is needed to get it
marked as a "stable" platform - that being one of my short-term goals.

My assumption is that it needs to (at least) pass all tests - and that
is why I keep asking for attention. All the PRs to fix individual tests
mean less if they are not merged, for whatever reason.

However, maybe there is another way, or even something additional
needed. Maybe something I cannot provide and then I can adjust my
expectations and goals.

Regards,

Michael

You don't like using Pool.starmap and itertools.repeat or a comprehension
that repeats an object?

FYI - as I now have access to the gccfarm, and in the spirit of more
generalized "posix" additions I looked for an HPUX and a Solais system
to build master on.

make test never finished (one test was still hanging after over 20
minutes, and I had to go. Of the 419, 17 or 18 had failed. Roughly where
AIX plus xlc was at last July without my PRs for tests.

So, while it worked - money stopped and Solaris is in no better
numerical shape (test wise) than AIX.
> Michael explicitly said this is a personal effort. IBM or other big

IBM is my employer. As I am not a developer (merely a systems and
management consultant) I do not face losing my job by working on OSS. I
have been called off certain OSS projects because IBM was providing
money and/or developers. This is one of the reasons (being called off
elsewhere) that I have been hesitant to be more involved than I was in
2015-2017.

So, let me be explicit - I can only speak for myself. And as long as no
manager says "No, cannot work on that" I have given a commitment to work
on this. "Some things cannot be bought" - such as un-biased (I call it
"maverick" rather than merely independent.) On the one hand IBM policy
is to encourage independent thought. The core goal is to help customers
succeed. But individual managers up and down the line occasionally have
additional business needs, and then workers as myself apologize and take
a step back - in a word - adjust.

Short answer: my involvement is mine to give at no price. I am
considered one of the worlds AIX experts on matters of integration,
performance and security.

So, I have just simple questions for you? Do you value my expertise? May
I assist?

First of all, congratulations on passing all test on AIX.

As a one of core developer, I don't know anything about AIX.
If my change breaks AIX build, I can't investigate what's happened.

So I think we need following in devguide:

* Brief description about AIX, from developer's point of view.
* How to run AIX on (VirtualBox, AWS EC2, Azure, GCP) easily.
* How to set up a development environment for Python.
* How to build Python.
* How to debug C code.

And even though there is a developer guide, it will take more long time
than fixing issues on AIX, compared Linux, macOS, and Windows.

But without this guide, it feels almost impossible to maintain AIX build to me.

This I might be able to do. Bullet form:
* Committed to POSIX standard (valid when release came out, so AIX 5.3
confirms to a different standard than AIX 7.2)
* While Linux affinity is recognized - GNU (or GNP - GNU not POSIX)
integration is not guaranteed. - GNU rte is not provided under support.
There is a so-called Toolbox, GNU an other OSS utilities supplied by
many packaged as RPMs. Unfortunately, different RPM providers (Michael
Perlz, BULL Freeware, IBM, and others) have different numbering (the
part after the package version, e.g., python-2.7.10-XXX so they do not
mix well). Headache for both admins and developers trying to develop in
a GNU-like environment.
* As a consultant, fedup with what is called the "RPM hell" by many AIX
admins - I do not use any RPMs. I build everything myself, using xlc
(gcc introduces the need for a GNU RTE, e.g., glibc). I package using
installp (the "native") AIX package manager, and strive to make the
packages independent (these days). When there are dependencies I try to
build them as static libraries so that they do not become an additional
install dependency.
* finally, a bit deeper: while the AIX linker loader supports svr4
shared libraries (it is the data, not the file name) it also supports
having multiple shared libraries in a classic archive. So, rather that
.../lib/libxxx.so and .../lib64/libxxx.so AIX prefers .../lib/libxxx.a
with two so-called members, with same or different names. The one found
is not it's name, but the symbol name and size of the ABI (32-bit or 64-bit)
* Hope that is enough of the key issues for now.
** In general, GNU autotools (autoreconf -f -v) works well, as does
configure.ac et al. for createing OSS Makefiles.
> * How to run AIX on (VirtualBox, AWS EC2, Azure, GCP) easily.
Easily! ? :) - well, on a POWER server it was easy enough for me to
follow the step by step instructions for creating a buildbot. If I had a
POWER server with more resources I would examine using the AIX internal
WPAR - however, a POWER server configured to use PowerVC uses "EC2" aka
cloud-init for creating a virtual machine. With that environment it
should be "easy" to provide additional instructions to cloud-init-ec2.

Or, I provide you a login on my personal server that I run the buildbot
on. etc. etc. - Where there is a will, there is a way.
> * How to set up a development environment for Python.
Again, follow the instructions for setting up a buildbot.
> * How to build Python.
git clone ...
autoreconf -v -f (as needed)
./configure --with-pydebug? #gcc compiler
./configure --with-pydebug --without-computed-gotos # xlc compiler

> * How to debug C code.
I learned, 40 years ago, using adb (a debugger) - I do a lot of
single-stepping. gdb is not the default debugger. If I were a developer
I would probably dig into the AIX debuggers (there are at least two, kdb
(kernel debugger, which I do use occaisionally for performance issues)
and another I try to avoid. I add fprintf statements and am looking at
learning how to use probevue.

In short, you probably have many much better ideas on how to debug C
than I do :)

IMHO: The AIX build is stable, but this is unrecognized because it does
have differences that cause tests to fail. I can think of one test that
PASSes, but should fail. And another test that passes, but should have
failed (in test_uuid) I have submitted a PR.

I tried to fix "all" in one PR, which confused people - so redid it as
two (got _uuid working in Python 3.7 ! yes!!) but the "original" to fix
uuid.py and test_uuid.py is still "awaiting change review".

My gut feeling to maintaining AIX is: a) all test pass so a potential
regression is flagged; b) someone such as myself who knows the platform
and can establish a "root cause" on why it is failing with AIX so that
c) a developer becomes aware and can decide to ignore or adjust; d)
alternatives - such as work around an implementation limitation (as I
try to do, e.g., for test_time and the related _datetime.c) is yet
another path.

In other words - it needs to be a shared responsibility - some
volunteers with a passion for platform stability (in this specific case
AIX and me as "passionate-person" and perhaps someone as youself who
wants to focus on the language itself - ideally without deep (or any!)
concern for platform differences.

This is an implementation detail. Currently CPython doesn't ensure that 
keyword argument names are identifiers for performance reasons. But this 
can be changed in future versions or in other implementations.

Starmap will serialize/deserialize the ?big object? once for each task
created, so this is not performant. The goal is to pay the ?one time cost?
of serialization of the ?big object?, and still pass this object to func at
each iteration.

I feel like it would be nicer to spell this:

with Pool() as pool:
    pool.map(functools.partial(func, big_cache=big_cache), ls)

And this might also solve your problem, if pool.map is clever enough
to only send the function object once to each worker?

No, but it is *a* way to get features into Python.

It may be a good way to get a feature that is important to (generic) 
you, but the core devs don't have enough time, interest or energy to add 
in their own free time.

It is not a way to get features that are opposed by the core devs.

Naturally whenever money is involved, there is the risks of a conflict 
of interest, and of course we should be careful about such risks. But 
they are small and manageable risks.

We're unlikely to be talking about huge amounts of money, enough to 
corrupt people, and so long as there is transparency about who does what 
and why, open source and free software is compatible with payment for 
work done. Even Richard Stallman accepts money for code :-)

What you're saying is sensible, the team is small enough and tightly knit that we trust each other. However, trust is not the point. It's about clear expectations and avoiding anarchy. As Nick points out elsewhere, circumventing the lack of governance by "asking a few friends" on the core team creates a need for the new leadership to ratify those changes. Speaking frankly, it would be a major shit show if any of those changes were to be reverted. As the release manager of this version of Python, can I ask you please not to risk this?

Ironically, the governance model I am championing is one that would closely resemble what you're describing. A community of experts, no kings: https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-8012-the-community-model/156/

So it's really not that I disagree with you, I do. It's not that I don't trust Petr, I do. It's that I believe the core team needs to formalize how they want the project to proceed before they go run approving PEPs.

Any sub-PEP changes are fair game at the moment.


> This change, if made, should be early in the cycle for the next version, rather than landing just before the first beta.

There is little to be gained in landing "early in the cycle" when alpha releases are not widely available anywhere and there is a 6-month long beta period. More importantly, using "we need to land fast" as an argument to rush things in is self-defeating.


> A language syntax-change proposal would be something else.

Anything that is big enough to require a PEP is by definition a substantial change and controversial that way. As somebody else here points out, there is even a competing PEP. That sounds controversial to me.

?ukasz, as the release manager for 3.8 you're the closest we have to an 
authority, so I defer to your judgment. No PEPs can currently be accepted.


Anyway, even if I was a *-delegate here, I would need to hear Mark 
Shannon's opinion on the PEP. Convincing him will probably be harder 
than convincing me.

Hi Michael,

being on a similar road with Gentoo Prefix, I really do appreciate
your AIX related work!

However, for two (not so minor) topics I've got a little different
experience, which I think should be mentioned here for completion:

Using gcc does *not* require to use glibc or even GNU binutils at all.
Except for gcc's own runtime libraries, there's no need for a GNU RTE.
In fact, in Gentoo Prefix I do use gcc as the compiler, configured to
use AIX provided binutils (as, ld, nm, ...), with AIX libc as RTE.

While this all is true, having multiple *versions* of one shared library in
one single file is a PITA for package managers - both human or software.

But fortunately, the AIX linker does support so called "Import Files",
allowing for *filename based* shared library versioning like on Linux,
while still allowing for both ABIs in a single library archive file.

For example, libtool provides the --with-aix-soname={aix|svr4|both}
configure flag since libtool-2.4.4.  Although the default will stay
at 'aix' here, in Gentoo Prefix I do use 'svr4' only.  This actually
is a package manager's decision, ideally for all depending packages.
As gcc does use libtool, for more information please refer to
https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html#WithAixSoname
But note that "Import Files" should work with xlc as well.

Thanks!

I think the author was referring to the dependency on libgcc_s when using gcc.
It's typical for native UNIX package builders to use gcc only when necessary because the correct runtime is always installed (if the os running it is newer) and therefore won't clash when something else in the process space is using a different version of libgcc_s (I'm not sure what the ABI guarantees are with libgcc_s specifically, and neither are UNIX packagers - not necessarily anyway)
It also eliminates the need to ship a version of libgcc_s as a shared library.

Well, this is something I learned - second hand - from someone who
worked hard to make much more OSS available than I. Probably wrong then
- in how I came to my conclusion - but the few things I tried to compile
"asis" to shared libraries would not work without also a lot of the gcc
compiler libraries. While I could have bitten the bullet and just found
a way to add those I was warned that different versions of gcc need
different level of supporting files.

Yes, it is a necessary pain. My secret is a) do not touch /usr/lib -
leave what is as it is, and in the few situations where it must be in
/usr/lib I add/replace named archive members with my new ones - and all
the other ones get extracted, modify a flag in their respective header -
so that the linker knows they are only to be used for applications that
expect them - not for new applications.

Actually, more detail than I really want to know. I recall the day when
a library was a collection of "static" .o files, and ranlib was nearly
always needed - Or you told the linker to link against that library
multiple times. And I recall going to my first conference where "RPC"
was the next greatest thing, and shared libraries were going to be such
a space savior - both on disk and in memory. And I was always more of a
bsd fan having schooled myself on UNIX v7, then bsd (2.9 iirc) and bsd
4.1, 4.2 (in comes tcpip) and 4.3. But I diverge :p

To return briefly to the question of what is AIX for the developer -
very flexible. You can choose your architecture and it generally, just
works. I wrote some scripts as a front-end for packaging and most
packages are a one-liner - that runs configure, make, makeinstall (using
DESTDIR) and then packaging the DESTDIR.

As far as python development and AIX goes I am open to helping others.
Been doing that for more years than I care to count. :)

Thank you Rob. My core mistake is calling it glibc (that is the gnome
libc not that I think back), and libgcc* are something else entirely.

In any case, I need to get my facts more accurate.

That would make life easier. Would probably have to package gcc on my
own to get it work that way though.

I'm also fine with saying that keys in **kwargs that are not proper

I like Guido's reasoning that syntax probably shouldn't be affected by
overloads unless otherwise documented as so, and Benjamin's approach to
solving it for 3.8 and then potentially reverting if it breaks too much.

I was going to suggest that Guido list himself as BDFL-Delegate as
then it could follow the same caretaker model we're suggesting for the
fast C calling API.

Message-ID: <E4F22DD5-4C14-4EB8-971E-302184351533@python.org>

[duplicated from https://discuss.python.org/c/committers]

We issued the 3.7.1rc1 and 3.6.7rc1 release candidates a little over 11 days ago with the plan to have final releases for each available by today, assuming no new issues arose since the rc1 cutoffs.  While the good news is that, to the best of my knowledge, no regressions have been reported for the release candidates (or remain unfixed), several critical and security-related issues have identified during the rc phase.  Most of these have already been addressed (thanks for the quick responses!) but there remain a couple that still need to be finalized.  Since there is a non-zero amount of fixes going in after rc1, I think we need to do another set of release candidates once everything is resolved.  Because a number of core developers are right now attending various Python-related events, I am going to aim for tagging 3.7.1rc2 and 3.6.7rc2 after 2018-10-09 23:59 AoE, if at all possible, with final releases targeted for about 10 days later.  I will send out an update as we approach that time.

Just a reminder to core developers: as always please try to get fixes merged in to all relevant branches as soon as you feel they are ready.  There is no need to hold off during a release candidate phase.  Release managers will cherry pick as necessary appropriate fixes from the release branches into subsequent release candidates or final releases.  The sooner changes are merged, the sooner they will get buildbot exposure and potential exposure in the wider community.

Thanks!

It's not just **kwargs -- you can also use arbitrary names with setattr() /
getattr() :

In [6]: setattr(foo, "4 not an identifier", "this works")

In [7]: getattr(foo, "4 not an identifier")
Out[7]: 'this works'

Which brings up a question I've had for years -- is the fact that cPython
uses a regular old dict for namespaces (and **kwargs) part of the language
spec, or an implementation detail?

I would say that for the get/setattr() example, it is kinda handy when you
want to use a class instance to model some external data structure that may
have different identifier rules. Though I tend to think that's mingling
data and code too much.

*locals *and *globals* are documented as dictionaries (for example exec's
documentation states that " If only *globals* is provided, it must be a
dictionary") but __dict__ is described as " [a] dictionary or other mapping
object".

I would consider it a feature. My reasoning is that the restriction on
what can be used as an identifier is a syntax restriction, not a
general restriction on what attributes or names can be.

When this behavior of set/getattr was discussed a decade or so ago, 
Guido said not to disable it, but I believe he said it should not be 
considered a language feature.  There are other situations where CPython 
is 'looser' than the spec.

I'm pretty sure that all of these mappings that create namespaces are
*not* specified to be dicts.  globals() and locals() need to return
*something*, and dict is the only builtin mapping.  On the other hand,
it is explicit that changes to these dicts need not be reflected in the
namespace.

Note that the namespace defined by a class is *not* a dict, it's a
union (it may be a dict, or it may be slots):

    >>> class Foo:
    ...  __slots__ = ('a')
    ...  def __init__(self, x):
    ...   self.a = x
    ...   self.b = (x,)
    ... 
    >>> fu = Foo(1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "<stdin>", line 6, in __init__
    AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute 'c'
    >>> class Foo:
    ...  __slots__ = ('a')
    ...  def __init__(self, x):
    ...   self.a = x
    ... 
    >>> fu = Foo(1)
    >>> print(fu.a)
    1
    >>> print(fu.__dict__)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute '__dict__'

This is a useful optimization if there are a lot of Foo objects, and
is somewhat faster.  As I understand it, while nobody has yet found a
reason to optimize other namespaces in such a way (or extend them in
some way, for that matter), the option is intentionally open.

Message-ID: <CAOYw7dswp8KHAQby-DD8wARi6paj9owYv_6PtDP-2O6MjkZiZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We ran into an issue on the Anaconda Distribution recently where we
added libarchive-c to conda-build (so we can un-compress more source
archive formats than tarfile supports) and everything was good a few
hours, until it hit various CI systems where objdump is not installed.

I was a bit surprised by this dependency and wondered if there'd be
interest in a fallback path that inspects the elf with some fairly
simple python code to determine the soname instead? I have code that
works already - though it could do with and a tidy up - and has been
tested on a variety of architectures. Would CPython be interested in
an attempt to upstream this?

Is it documented anywhere that objdump is needed to load some
extension modules on Linux?


Best regards,

Ray Donnelly,

Wow, that looks like gross code buried within ctypes.util (which
libarchive-c uses) that calls various platforms versions of objdump or
equivalent.  File a bugs.python.org issue and submit a PR, native ELF
header reading code for this makes sense.

My feeling is that limiting it to strings is fine, but checking those
strings for resembling identifiers is pointless and wasteful.

We were debugging abysmally slow execution of Mercurial's test harness
on macOS and we discovered a new wrinkle to the startup time problem.

It appears that APFS acquires some shared locks/mutexes in the kernel
when executing readdir() and other filesystem system calls. When you
have several Python processes all starting at the same time, I/O
attached to module importing (import.c:case_ok() by the looks of it for
Python 2.7) becomes a stress test of sorts for this lock acquisition. On
my 6+6 core MacBook Pro, ~75% of overall system CPU is spent in the
kernel when executing the test harness with 12 parallel tests.

If we run the test harness with the persistent `chg` command server
(which eliminates Python process startup overhead), wall execution time
drops from ~37:43s to ~9:06s.

This problem of shared locks on read-only operations appears to be
similar to that of AUFS, which I've blogged about [1].

It is pretty common for non-compiled languages (like Python, Ruby, PHP,
Perl, etc) to stat() the world as part of looking for modules to load.
Typically, the filesystem's stat cache will save you and the overhead
from hundreds or thousands of lookups is trivial (after first load). But
it appears APFS is quite sensitive to it. Any work to reduce the number
of filesystem API calls during Python startup will likely have a
profound impact on APFS when multiple Python processes are starting. A
"frozen" application where modules are in a shared container file is
probably ideal.

Python 3.7 doesn't exhibit as much of a problem. But it is still there.
A brief audit of the importer code and call stacks confirms it is the
same problem - just less prevalent. Wall time execution of the test
harness from Python 2.7 to Python 3.7 drops from ~37:43s to ~20:39.
Overall kernel CPU time drops from ~75% to ~19%. And that wall time
improvement is despite Python 3's slower process startup. So locking in
the kernel is really a killer on Python 2.7.

While we're here, CPython might want to look into getdirentriesattr() as
a replacement for readdir(). We switched to it in Mercurial several
years ago to make `hg status` operations significantly faster [2]. I'm
not sure if it will yield a speedup on APFS though. But it's worth a
try. (If it does, you could probably make
os.listdir()/os.scandir()/os.walk() significantly faster on macOS.)

I hope someone finds this information useful to further improving
[startup] performance. (And given that Python 3.7 is substantially
faster by avoiding excessive readdir(), I wouldn't be surprised if this
problem is already known!)

The macOS problem wasn't known, but the general problem of filesystem
calls was (in relation with e.g. networked filesystems).

Significant work went into improving Python 3 in that regard after the
import mechanism was rewritten in pure Python.  Nowadays Python caches
the contents of all sys.path directories, so (once the cache is primed)
it's mostly a single stat() call per directory to check whether the
cache is up-to-date.  This is not entirely free, but massively better
than what Python 2 did, which was to stat() many filename patterns in
each sys.path directory.

(of course, the fact that Python 3 imports many more modules at startup
mitigates the end result a bit)


As a sidenote, I was always shocked with how the Mercurial test suite
was architected.  You're wasting so much time launching processes that
I wonder why you kept it that way for so long :-)

Regards

Antoine.

Are you speaking on behalf of all authors of alternate implementations, 
or even of some of them?

It certainly is not true that CPython's behaviour "is" the spec. PyPy 
keeps a list of CPython behaviour they don't match, either because they 
choose not to for other reasons, or because they believe that the 
CPython behaviour is buggy. I daresay IronPython and Jython have 
similar.

And this especially applies when CPython explicitly states that certain 
behaviour is implementation-dependent and could change in the future.

Sure. The question is, do we have to support uses where people 
intentionally smuggle non-identifier strings as keys via **kwargs?

I'm not saying we need to guard against it, only asking if we need to 
officially support it. The discussion on Python-Ideas is (partly) about 
making this a language feature.

I would not be in favor of that.  I think it doesn?t make sense to be able to smuggle those in via **kwargs when it?s not supported by Python?s grammar/syntax.

Well, it currently works in all Python implementations (definitely in
CPython, and presumably in PyPy and Jython because they tend to follow
CPython carefully). The less the spec leaves undefined the better, IMO, and
I fully expect we'll be breaking code that is doing this. So we might as
well make it the law.

For example, in some code bases it's a pretty common pattern to pass dicts
around using **kwds several levels deep, with no intention to unpack it
into individual keyword arguments -- the caller sends a dict, and the
receiver accepts a dict and does dict-y things to it. Sure, they probably
shouldn't be abusing **kwds, but they are, and I can't really blame them --
possibly this code evolved from a situation that did use keyword args.

Can anyone think of a situation where it would be advantageous for an implementation to reject non-identifier string kwargs? I can't.

I agree with Guido?banning it would be too much trouble for no benefit.

One possibility is that it could foreclose certain security bugs from
happening. For example, if someone has an API that accepts **kwargs,
they might have the mistaken assumption that the keys are identifiers
without special characters like ";" etc, and so they could make the
mistake of thinking they don't need to escape / sanitize them.

Hm, that's not an entirely unreasonable concern. How would an attacker get
such keys *into* the dict? One possible scenario would be something that
parses a traditional web query string into a dict, passes it down through
**kwds, and then turns it back into another query string without proper
quoting. But the most common (and easiest) way to turn a dict into a query
string is calling urlencode(), which quotes unsafe characters.

I think we needn't rush this (and when in doubt, status quo wins, esp. when
there's no BDFL :-).

With that line of reasoning, one should make sure the data are 
identifiers too :)

I was just thinking json. It could be a config-file type situation, or
a web API that accepts json.

For example, there are JSON-RPC implementations in Python:
https://pypi.org/project/json-rpc/
that translate json dicts directly into **kwargs:
https://github.com/pavlov99/json-rpc/blob/f1b4e5e96661efd4026cb6143dc3acd75c6c4682/jsonrpc/manager.py#L112

On the server side, the application could be doing something like
assuming that the kwargs are e.g. column names paired with values to
construct a string in SQL or in some other language or format.

I can. The space of identifiers is smaller than the space of all 
strings. We need just 6 bits per character for ASCII identifiers and 16 
bits per character for Unicode identifiers. We could use a special kind 
of strings for more compact representation of identifiers. It may be 
even possible to encode all identifiers used in the stdlib and in the 
program as a tagged 64-bit pointer. Currently dict has specialized code 
for string keys, it could have specialization for identifiers (used only 
for keyword arguments, instance dicts, etc). Argument parsing code can 
also utilize the fact that a special hash for short identifiers doesn't 
have collizions and compare just hashes.

All this looks fantastic, but I would not close doors for future 
optimizations.

Note that getdirentriesattr is deprecated as of macOS 10.10, getattrlistbulk
is the non-deprecated replacement (introduced in 10.10).

I've looked into this more and it is more subtle than my initial
report suggests (as usual).

We have some custom code in AD around find_library() so it looks in
sys.prefix/lib (on Unix) and I had a bug in that code when _get_soname
returned None. I've fixed that now.

I believe there is a condition under which this could go wrong which
is if the soname returned by objdump differs from the filename and
then the filename is not found. This would happen to people with
objdump installed but not to people without it installed, so I feel
the behaviour here should be unified. If you think we should unify it
by implementing a python replacement for this functionality then I'll
get on with a PR (and file that bug report too), the other option is
to just remove this part and have just the fallbacks happen instead?

This is exactly a use-case for non-identifier strings in kwargs. The
rules for valid field names could very well be different than Python?s
rules.

The kwargs implementation is not the place for sanitizing to take
place ? each app will need different sanitization rules.

I would expect this to be costly/annoying for implementations to enforce,
doing it at call time is probably too late to be efficient, it would need
help from dicts themselves or even strings.

A hack that currently works because of this is with dict itself:

>>> d = {'a-1': 1, 'a-2': 2, 'a-3': 3}
>>> d1 = dict(d, **{'a-2': -2, 'a-1': -1})
>>> d1 is d
False
>>> d1
{'a-1': -1, 'a-2': -2, 'a-3': 3}
>>>

Why not just pass a dict as an argument, rather than (ab)using kwargs?

Instead of:

- building a dict containing non-identifiers;
- unpacking it in the function call;
- have the interpreter re-pack it to a **kwargs;
- and then process it as a dict

we can cut out the two middle steps. So I must admit, I'm perplexed as 
to why people use an extra (superfluous?) ** to unpack a dict that's 
just going to be packed again. I just don't get it. *shrug*

I also wonder whether the use-cases for this would be reduced if we 
introduced verbatim names? 

https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-May/050791.html

Keys containing non-identifier characters like spaces and hyphens would 
still need the kwargs trick, but for reserved words you could just 
escape the argument:

def spam(eggs, \while=None):
    ...

spam(eggs=1234, \while=5678)


which frankly looks much better to me than 

spam(eggs=1234, **{"while": 5678})

This should be "time", not "times". I'd fix it, but I'm unsure if this 
is being backported or not, and I don't want to mess up any merges 
before they're done.

I do think this should backported to 3.7, 3.6, and 2.7.

And this would read better as "are even dropping support for Python 2.x".

Hi Nathaniel - this if this solution can be made performant, than I would
be more than satisfied.

I think this would require removing "func" from the "task tuple", and
storing the "func" "once per worker" somewhere globally (maybe a class
attribute set post-fork?).

This also has the beneficial outcome of increasing general performance of
Pool.map and friends. I've seen MANY folks across the interwebs doing
things like passing instance methods to map, resulting in "big" tasks, and
slower-than-sequential parallelized code. Parallelizing "instance methods"
by passing them to map, w/o needing to wrangle with staticmethods and
globals, would be a GREAT feature! It'd just be as easy as:

    Pool.map(self.func, ls)

What do you think about this idea? This is something I'd be able to take
on, assuming I get a few core dev blessings...

Well, I'm not sure how it would work, so it's difficult to give an
opinion.  How do you plan to avoid passing "self"?  By caching (by
equality? by identity?)?  Something else?  But what happens if "self"
changed value (in the case of a mutable object) in the parent?  Do you
keep using the stale version in the child?  That would break
compatibility...

The implementation details need to be flushed out, but agnostic of these,
do you believe this a valid solution to the initial problem? Do you also
see it as a beneficial optimization to Pool, given that we don't need to
store funcs/bound-methods/partials on the tasks themselves?

The latter concern about "what happens if `self` changed value in the
parent" is the same concern as "what happens if `func` changes in the
parent?" given the current implementation. This is an assumption that is
currently made with Pool.map_async(func, ls). If "func" changes in the
parent, there is no communication with the child. So one just needs to be
aware that calling "map_async(self.func, ls)" while the state of "self" is
changing, will not communicate changes to each worker. The state is frozen
when Pool.map is called, just as is the case now.

I'm not sure, TBH.  I also think it may be better to leave this to
higher levels (for example Dask will intelligently distribute data on
workers and let you work with a kind of proxy object in the main
process, transfering data only when necessary).

If you cache "self" between pool.map calls, then the question is not
"what happens if self changes *during* a map() call" but "what happens
if self changes *between* two map() calls"?  While the former is
intuitively undefined, current users would expect the latter to have a
clear answer, which is: the latest version of self when map() is called
is taken into account.

Antoine.

I would contend that this is much more granular than Dask - this is just an
optimization of Pool.map() to avoid redundantly passing the same `func`
repeatedly, once per task, to each worker, with the primary goal of
eliminating redundant serialization of large-memory-footprinted Callables.
This is a different use case than Dask - I don't intend to approach the
shared memory or distributed computing realms.

And the second call to Pool.map would update the cached "self" as a part of
its initialization workflow, s.t. "the latest version of self when map() is
called is taken into account".

Do you see a difficulty in accomplishing the second behavior?

I still don't understand how that works.  If you "updated the cached
self", then surely you must transmit it to the child, right?

Yes - ?func? (and ?self? which func is bound to) would be copied to each
child worker process, where they are stored and applied to each element of

Only if it has changed, then, right?

I suspect that would work, but it will break compatibility in some cases
(think of a mutable object that hasn't defined equality - so it defaults
to identity).  It's also introducing a complication in the API which
people didn't have to think of before.

The fact that you're doing all this in order to eschew global variables
for global resources doesn't warm me much to the idea.  Unless other
core developers are enthusiastic I'm not willing to integrate such a change.

Regards

Antoine.

I was just suggesting that within a single call to Pool.map, it would be
reasonable optimization to only send the fn once to each worker. So e.g. if
you have 5 workers and 1000 items, you'd only pickle fn 5 times, rather
than 1000 times like we do now. I wouldn't want to get any fancier than
that with caching data between different map calls or anything.

Of course even this may turn out to be too complicated to implement in a
reasonable way, since it would require managing some extra state on the
workers. But semantically it would be purely an optimization of current
semantics.

Or just remove ?at this time[s]?; it doesn?t add much.

While agreeing with the principle, unless it is one of the fundamental 
differences (GC, GIL), Jython usually lets practicality beat purity. 
When faced with a certain combination of objects, one has to do 
something, and it is least surprising to do what CPython does. It's also 
easier than keeping a record.

Rarely, we manage to exceed CPython (in consistency or coverage) by a 
tiny amount.

@Nataniel this is what I am suggesting as well. No cacheing - just storing
the `fn` on each worker, rather than pickling it for each item in our
iterable.

As long as we store the `fn` post-fork on the worker process (perhaps as
global), subsequent calls to Pool.map shouldn't be effected (referencing
Antoine's & Michael's points that "multiprocessing encapsulates each
subprocesses globals in a separate namespace").

@Antoine - I'm making an effort to take everything you've said into
consideration here.  My initial PR and talk
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH0JVSXvxu0> was intended to shed light on
a couple of pitfalls that I often see Python end-users encounter with Pool.
Moving beyond my naive first attempt, and the onslaught of deserved
criticism, it seems that we have an opportunity here: No changes to the
interface, just an optimization to reduce the frequency of pickling.

Raymond Hettinger may also be interested in this optimization, as he speaks
(with great analogies) about different ways you can misuse concurrency in
Python <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zinZmE3Ogk>. This would address
one of the pitfalls that he outlines: the "size of the
serialized/deserialized data".

Is this an optimization that either of you would be willing to review, and
accept, if I find there is a *reasonable way* to implement it?

Would this change the other pool method behavior in some way if the user,
for whatever reason, mixed techniques?

imap_unordered will only block when nexting the generator. If the user
mingles nexting that generator with, say, apply_async, could the change
you're proposing have some side-effect?

When faced with a certain combination of objects, one has to do something, and it is least surprising to do what CPython does. It's also easier than keeping a record.

This is how it is for IronPython as well. When the pool of potential
users is already small, one cannot afford to get too pedantic about
whether something is in the spec or not. Matching what CPython does is
the easiest way to make sure as many people as possible can use an
alternative implementation.

Is your concern something like the following?

with Pool(8) as p:
    gen = p.imap_unordered(func, ls)
    first_elem = next(gen)
    p.apply_async(long_func, x)
    remaining_elems = [elem for elem in gen]

...here, if we store "func" on each worker Process as a global, and execute
this pattern above, we will likely alter state of one of the worker
processes s.t. it stores "long_func" in place of the initial "func".

So yes, this could break things. *A potential solution*:

Replace "func" in the task tuple with an identifier (maybe, *perhaps

This would avoid the weird stateful bug above. We could also do something
slightly different to this if folks are averse to the "Pool class-attribute
func map" (i.e. averse to globals), and store this map as an Instance
Attribute on the Pool object, and wrap the "initializer" func to make the
map globally available in the worker via the "global" keyword.

One note: this isn't a "cache", it's just a global map which has its keys &
values updated *blindly* with every call to Pool.<public_method>. It serves
as a way to bypass repeated serialization of functions in Pool, which can
be large when bound to big objects (like large class instances, or
functools.partial objects).
