Hi Core Developers,

First thing: I am *not* a CPython committer.  I think most of you who are
will be somewhat familiar with me though.

Second: I was a Director of the PSF for a long while, and continue to chair
some Working Groups.  I've been mentioned in some PEPs.  I have written a
lot of articles and have given a lot of talks about Python, including about
recent or pending PEPs and similar matters.  I continue to work and train
around Python and open source (now with a focus on "data science", whatever
that is).

Third: I follow python-ideas and python-dev rather closely, and fairly
often contribute ideas to those lists.

Fourth: As I read PEP 8016, I cannot nominate myself to the Steering
Committee.  That seems good and proper to me.  But I believe I would be a
relevant and helpful member of the future Steering Committee if someone
wishes to nominate me and if the voters wish to elect me.

Thanks, David Mertz...

The primary question I would ask an external candidate is: how is it
that you never became a core developer (which implies some amount of
effort and dedication) but nevertheless would be willing to spend the
effort and dedication needed for serving on a Steering Council (*)?

(*) (or Committee, I don't remember :-))

Regards

Antoine.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Return type of datetime subclasses added to timedelta
Message-ID: <1059740e-cc65-205d-5986-a9397463a315@ganssle.io>

Happy New Year everyone!

I would like to start a thread here for wider feedback on my proposal to
change the return type of the addition operation between a datetime
subclass and a timedelta. Currently, adding a timedelta to a subclass of
datetime /always/ returns a datetime rather than an instance of the
datetime subclass.

I have an open PR implementing this, PR #10902
<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10902>, but I know it's a major
change so I did not want to move forward without more discussion. I
first brought this up on datetime-SIG
<https://mail.python.org/archives/list/datetime-sig at python.org/thread/TGB3VZS5EKM4R2VFUA44323FZFRN2DSJ/>
[1], and we decided to move the discussion over here because the people
most likely to object to the change would be on this list and not on
datetime-SIG.

In addition to the datetime-SIG thread, you may find a detailed
rationale for the change in bpo-35364
<https://bugs.python.org/issue35364#msg331065> [2],? and a rationale for
why we would want to (and arguably already /do/) support subclassing
datetime in bpo-32417 <https://bugs.python.org/issue32417#msg331353> [3].

A short version of the strongest rationale for changing how this works
is that it is causing inconsistencies in how subclassing is handled in
alternate constructors of datetime. For a given subclass of datetime
(which I will call DateTimeSub), nearly all alternate constructors
already support subclasses correctly - DateTimeSub.fromtimestamp(x) will
return a DateTimeSub, for example. However, because DateTimeSub +
timedelta returns datetime, any alternate constructor implemented in
terms of timedelta additions will leak that implementation detail by
returning a datetime object instead of the subclass. The biggest problem
is that datetime.fromutc is defined in terms of timedelta addition, so
DateTimeSub.now() returns a DateTimeSub object, but
DateTimeSub.now(timezone.utc) returns a datetime object! This is one of
the most annoying things to work around when building a datetime
subclass, and I don't know of any situation where someone /wants/ their
subclass to be lost on addition with a timedelta.

From my understanding, this has been discussed before and the original
objection was that this implementation assumes that the datetime
subclass has a constructor with the same (or a sufficiently similar)
signature as datetime. This may be a legitimate gripe, but unfortunately
that ship has sailed long ago. All of datetime's alternate constructors
make this assumption. Any subclass that does not meet this requirement
must have worked around it long ago (or they don't care about alternate
constructors).

Thanks for your attention, I look forward to your replies.

Best,

Paul

David may of course provide an answer for himself, but allow me to
provide my answer (and this is why I pushed for allowing external
nominations).

Historically, the only reason to become a core committer was to commit
code. Some of us no doubt desired or demonstrated greater influence, but
all of us have committed code or reviewed and merged PRs, either
directly to CPython or one of the related projects.

This is not a job for everyone, but it's been the only job we had on offer.

The closest alternative job was to be elected to the board of the Python
Software Foundation. But this is still not a job for everyone. They also
are not considered core committers, despite making significant
contributions.

We now have a new job on offer. Exactly what that job involves isn't
quite defined yet, but it will certainly include some amount of
project/program/process management, likely some customer/user engagement
(or relationship management, if you prefer), and potentially some
independent decision making.

Guido is the only core developer who has previously contributed to
Python in this way (whatever "this way" turns out to mean). The rest of
us happily worked under "someone else" doing it.

Meanwhile, many non-core committers in the Python community have spent
their time building companies, consulting businesses or educational
courses. Spending time writing code and reviewing PRs is not how they
want to contribute, and so they have contributed in other ways -
including writing and often reviewing PEPs. There was no need for them
to be a core committer, since they weren't doing any of the
committer-specific tasks.

In the PEP 8016 discussions (pre vote), we agreed that if we chose to
elect someone who is not currently a core developer, we would also
probably vote to make them a core developer, so there is no harm in
allowing externals to be nominated. Also since the core committers are
voluntarily submitting to their guidance, it makes sense that voting to
elect/dissolve is restricted to us.

In summary, members of the Steering Council are filling a new role with
only one explicit precedent within the core committers. The
qualifications are different, and so the pool of candidates is
different. The existing core committers will submit to the Steering
Council, and so are the ones who elect them.

(Note that I've carefully used "core committer" and "core developer"
above. I believe it's very important to distinguish between "write
access on GitHub" and "project decision maker", and no reason to force
an arbitrary overlap.)

Cheers,
Steve
