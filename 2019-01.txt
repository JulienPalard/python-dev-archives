Hi Core Developers,

First thing: I am *not* a CPython committer.  I think most of you who are
will be somewhat familiar with me though.

Second: I was a Director of the PSF for a long while, and continue to chair
some Working Groups.  I've been mentioned in some PEPs.  I have written a
lot of articles and have given a lot of talks about Python, including about
recent or pending PEPs and similar matters.  I continue to work and train
around Python and open source (now with a focus on "data science", whatever
that is).

Third: I follow python-ideas and python-dev rather closely, and fairly
often contribute ideas to those lists.

Fourth: As I read PEP 8016, I cannot nominate myself to the Steering
Committee.  That seems good and proper to me.  But I believe I would be a
relevant and helpful member of the future Steering Committee if someone
wishes to nominate me and if the voters wish to elect me.

Thanks, David Mertz...

The primary question I would ask an external candidate is: how is it
that you never became a core developer (which implies some amount of
effort and dedication) but nevertheless would be willing to spend the
effort and dedication needed for serving on a Steering Council (*)?

(*) (or Committee, I don't remember :-))

Regards

Antoine.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Return type of datetime subclasses added to timedelta
Message-ID: <1059740e-cc65-205d-5986-a9397463a315@ganssle.io>

Happy New Year everyone!

I would like to start a thread here for wider feedback on my proposal to
change the return type of the addition operation between a datetime
subclass and a timedelta. Currently, adding a timedelta to a subclass of
datetime /always/ returns a datetime rather than an instance of the
datetime subclass.

I have an open PR implementing this, PR #10902
<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10902>, but I know it's a major
change so I did not want to move forward without more discussion. I
first brought this up on datetime-SIG
<https://mail.python.org/archives/list/datetime-sig at python.org/thread/TGB3VZS5EKM4R2VFUA44323FZFRN2DSJ/>
[1], and we decided to move the discussion over here because the people
most likely to object to the change would be on this list and not on
datetime-SIG.

In addition to the datetime-SIG thread, you may find a detailed
rationale for the change in bpo-35364
<https://bugs.python.org/issue35364#msg331065> [2],? and a rationale for
why we would want to (and arguably already /do/) support subclassing
datetime in bpo-32417 <https://bugs.python.org/issue32417#msg331353> [3].

A short version of the strongest rationale for changing how this works
is that it is causing inconsistencies in how subclassing is handled in
alternate constructors of datetime. For a given subclass of datetime
(which I will call DateTimeSub), nearly all alternate constructors
already support subclasses correctly - DateTimeSub.fromtimestamp(x) will
return a DateTimeSub, for example. However, because DateTimeSub +
timedelta returns datetime, any alternate constructor implemented in
terms of timedelta additions will leak that implementation detail by
returning a datetime object instead of the subclass. The biggest problem
is that datetime.fromutc is defined in terms of timedelta addition, so
DateTimeSub.now() returns a DateTimeSub object, but
DateTimeSub.now(timezone.utc) returns a datetime object! This is one of
the most annoying things to work around when building a datetime
subclass, and I don't know of any situation where someone /wants/ their
subclass to be lost on addition with a timedelta.

From my understanding, this has been discussed before and the original
objection was that this implementation assumes that the datetime
subclass has a constructor with the same (or a sufficiently similar)
signature as datetime. This may be a legitimate gripe, but unfortunately
that ship has sailed long ago. All of datetime's alternate constructors
make this assumption. Any subclass that does not meet this requirement
must have worked around it long ago (or they don't care about alternate
constructors).

Thanks for your attention, I look forward to your replies.

Best,

Paul

David may of course provide an answer for himself, but allow me to
provide my answer (and this is why I pushed for allowing external
nominations).

Historically, the only reason to become a core committer was to commit
code. Some of us no doubt desired or demonstrated greater influence, but
all of us have committed code or reviewed and merged PRs, either
directly to CPython or one of the related projects.

This is not a job for everyone, but it's been the only job we had on offer.

The closest alternative job was to be elected to the board of the Python
Software Foundation. But this is still not a job for everyone. They also
are not considered core committers, despite making significant
contributions.

We now have a new job on offer. Exactly what that job involves isn't
quite defined yet, but it will certainly include some amount of
project/program/process management, likely some customer/user engagement
(or relationship management, if you prefer), and potentially some
independent decision making.

Guido is the only core developer who has previously contributed to
Python in this way (whatever "this way" turns out to mean). The rest of
us happily worked under "someone else" doing it.

Meanwhile, many non-core committers in the Python community have spent
their time building companies, consulting businesses or educational
courses. Spending time writing code and reviewing PRs is not how they
want to contribute, and so they have contributed in other ways -
including writing and often reviewing PEPs. There was no need for them
to be a core committer, since they weren't doing any of the
committer-specific tasks.

In the PEP 8016 discussions (pre vote), we agreed that if we chose to
elect someone who is not currently a core developer, we would also
probably vote to make them a core developer, so there is no harm in
allowing externals to be nominated. Also since the core committers are
voluntarily submitting to their guidance, it makes sense that voting to
elect/dissolve is restricted to us.

In summary, members of the Steering Council are filling a new role with
only one explicit precedent within the core committers. The
qualifications are different, and so the pool of candidates is
different. The existing core committers will submit to the Steering
Council, and so are the ones who elect them.

(Note that I've carefully used "core committer" and "core developer"
above. I believe it's very important to distinguish between "write
access on GitHub" and "project decision maker", and no reason to force
an arbitrary overlap.)

Cheers,
Steve

Not exactly.  Nick's role on packaging comes to mind.  More modestly,
several of us have served as BDFL delegates, have steered various
processes (such as VCS migration), and/or have been responsible
(officially or not) for subparts of the project (such as documentation,
buildbots, version control...).

The Council is going to be a 5-person body, some some amount of
involvement and dedication is expected from each of the Council's
members if we want it to function correctly (it's probably not just a
supervision body where you can participate in a meeting every 3 months,
answer a couple e-mails and call it done).

I already have a hard time imagining my level of involvement being
enough for candidating on the Council.  So I would be skeptical of
voting for someone who hasn't submitted a single patch to the codebase
in 10+ years, for example.

Moreover, someone who has never contributed to the codebase hasn't
really experienced how contributing works, which doesn't make them a
very good candidate for managing contributors, IMHO.

Regards

Antoine.

I do not wish to presume too much on the judgement of the core developers.
But I thank Steve Dower for his characterizations which pretty much exactly
explain why I've had those involvements with the Python community and
language I have had, and haven't done other things.

I've been part of the Python community since 1998, but really active in it
since about 2001.  During the early 2000s, I wrote a large number of widely
read articles promoting Python, often delving into explaining semi-obscure
features and language design issues.  Most of these were with in my column
_Charming Python_.  I believe that several changes in Python itself?such as
making coroutines easier to use and the design of metaclasses and class
decorators?were significantly influenced by things I wrote on the topics.

Mostly in the period after writing that column, i.e. during the 2010s, I
served as a Director of the PSF; both before and since my time as a
Director, I've chaired several PSF committees.  That likewise felt like a
way I could advance Python best, but from more of an organizational or
social perspective than a technical one.  It is interesting to me that
whereas when I started volunteering for the PSF, there was significant
overlap between the PSF board and the core-committers, I think there is
little or no overlap today.  For better or worse, PSF is much more
community than technical today.  I feel like my own skills and interest
remain somewhat at the intersection of those aspects of Python.

I did not choose during that time, nor since, to become a CPython core
developer.  I've certainly contributed to other projects in the Python
ecosystem (I'm not sure if those are "related projects" in the sense Steve
mentions).  Part of that is time commitment needed, but more of it is my
personal strategic choices about what I could best do to advance Python in
the world.  I've felt I can do more by writing, speaking, and participating
in the PSF, than I would have by working on the CPython code base itself.

In particular, I always felt that I am not nearly as strong of a *C*
developer as are most core developers.  In Python itself, yes, but not in
C.  I am certain that I could have found some small bug to fix or small
feature to add, and gotten it accepted.  But doing that would have taken me
comparatively more effort than it would many others; I felt that effort was
better targeted towards educating Python users and teaching the user-level
language design choices Python has made.

If the core developers feel that the overwhelming qualification for the
Steering Committee is familiarity with the C code base of CPython, then
indeed I am not the best candidate for that.  If language design issues are
more important?and especially if thinking about Python's place among users
and industry are important, then I think I'm a very good candidate for the
role.  In particular, I believe my judgement about "Is this feature good
for Python users?" would be as good as that of most anyone (maybe other
than Guido); but I recognize that my judgement about "Is this feature
straightforward to implement in CPython?" or "What are the performance
implications of this features?" are weaker than those of most core
developers.  Not to say I have *no* instinct about those other questions,
but I know to defer.

Best, David...

Those are useful things to know, thank you.

Obviously not the overwhelming qualification (though at least _some_ of
the committee members would have to be familiar with the C code base, I
think).

That, but I think also familiarity with the development and
contribution process, will definitely play a role.  In other words, if
some external candidate gets elected I would hope they take the time to
become familiar with how things work in that regard, and try to
contribute themselves (not necessarily to make important contributions
to the codebase but to understand the daily routine).

While this was used as a possible rationale for the way standard types
behave, the main objection to changing datetime classes is that it will
make them behave differently from builtins.  For example:

>>> class F(float):
...     pass
...
>>> type(F.fromhex('AA'))
<class '__main__.F'>
>>> type(F(1) + F(2))
<class 'float'>

This is right, but the same argument is equally applicable to int, float,
etc. subclasses.  If you want to limit your change to datetime types you
should explain what makes these types special.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Compilation of "except FooExc as var" adds useless
 store
Message-ID: <20190106131048.6e0a3dd8@x230>

Hello,

As explained in
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement ,

except E as N:
    foo

is actually compiled as:

except E as N:
    try:
        foo
    finally:
        del N

But looking at the generated bytecode, it's worse than that:

             16 STORE_NAME               1 (N)
             18 POP_TOP
             20 SETUP_FINALLY            8 (to 30)

  4          22 LOAD_NAME                2 (foo)
             24 POP_TOP
             26 POP_BLOCK
             28 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
        >>   30 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             32 STORE_NAME               1 (N)
             34 DELETE_NAME              1 (N)
             36 END_FINALLY


It's clear that what happens there is that first None is stored to N,
just to del it as the next step. Indeed, that's what done in the
compile.c:

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/compile.c#L2905

Storing None looks superfluous. For example, DELETE_FAST explicitly
stores NULL on delete.
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ceval.c#L2249 

Likewise, for DELETE_NAME/DELETE_GLOBAL, PyObject_DelItem() is
called which translates to:

m->mp_ass_subscript(o, key, (PyObject*)NULL);

So hopefully any compliant mapping implementation actually clears
stored value, not leaving it dangling.

The "store None" behavior can be traced down to introduction of the
"del except target var" behavior back in 2007:
https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b940e113bf90ff71b0ef57414ea2beea9d2a4bc0#diff-cb296cc5109f5640ff3f6d7198a6abeeR1999

There's no clear explanation why it's done like that, so probably an
artifact of the initial implementation. Note that even
https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/520b7ae27e39d1c77ea74ccd1b184d7cb43f9dcb
which did quite a bunch of refactoring to "except" implementation, and
reformatted this code, otherwise left it in place.

P.S.
I actually wanted to argue that such an implementation is hardly ideal
at all. Consider:

----
e = "my precious data"

try:
    1/0
except Exception as e:
    pass

# Where's my *global* variable?
# Worse, my variable can be gone or not, depending on whether exception
# triggered or not.
print(e)
----

So, perhaps the change should be not removing "e = None" part, but
conversely, removing the "del e" part.

With something as clearly deliberate as this, it's generally safe to
assume there's a good reason for it. But I would very much like to see
that reason documented, preferably with an example of something that
could otherwise fail.

No, there's a good reason for having the "del e", and that's to
prevent reference loops (since the exception includes the full
traceback, including all local variables). However, I would argue -
and HAVE argued - that this would be a perfect situation for an inner
scope, where the inner variable "e" is actually shadowing, rather than
overwriting, your outer "e". But the push-back against *that* proposal
was insane.

Absolutely, and one doesn't need to look far for an example. For 20
years Python was devoid of ":=", then, suddenly... ;-).

Yeah, I'm keen to know too!

So, I'm not sure if I made that clear, but the issue is that currently
the generated code tries to break the reference loop *twice*. But once
should be enough. And which one of "N = None" or "del N" is better is
something to consider.

That's not "worse", that's BETTER.

With e deleted, you get an immediate exception the moment you try to use 
it, and you *know* something has gone wrong, instead of the program 
continuing, either to fail much later, where it isn't clear why the code 
fails, or worse, not fail at all, but instead silently do the wrong 
thing.

Incorrect code that fails sooner is better than incorrect code that 
fails later, and MUCH better than incorrect code that doesn't fail at 
all.

The real problem here is that if e holds your precious data, why are you 
assigning an exception to e? You probably wouldn't complain that this 
breaks your program:

e = "my precious data"
import sys as e
# where is my data???

or this:

e = "my precious data"
e = None

so why do you expect `except Exception as e` to be different? Its just a 
name binding operation, the same as all the others.

Regardless of the mechanism, if you don't want to lose your precious 
data, then don't use the same name. But if you truly, really must 
overwrite e, then there is a simple work-around:

e = "my precious data"
try:
    1/0
except Exception as err:
    e = err


Having the exception name unbound at the end of the block is a weird and 
unfortunate wart on the language, but not as unfortunate as having 
exceptions cause long-lasting reference cycles.

Ack. Such an explanation makes sense, though semantics behind it is
"magic". And given that variable deletion happens conditionally on
whether exception happened or not, it's still pretty strange. I would
definitely find a behavior of merely clearing an "except" target
variable to be more understandable than magic fiddling with namespaces.

[]

Because I got an idea that "except Exc as var" introduces a nested
lexical scope for "var"? I.e., a completely new variable is introduced,
which may shadow, but not override, any on the enclosing scope.

Why would I get that idea? Well, because lexical scoping is a
well-known concept in many programming languages, Python included. For
example, list/set/etc. comprehensions have proper lexical scope, how
would I imagine that specifically in except clauses, it's not a proper
lexical scoping, but a leaky "emulation" of it? 

That said, the description in
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement
doesn't give any false promises regarding lexical scoping. Instead, it
effectively says that the behavior is CPython implementation detail:

"Exceptions are cleared because with the traceback attached to them,
they form a reference cycle"


So, the only thing to take away from this might be indeed an opportunity
to save 4 bytes of bytecode/2 dispatches.

Thanks, that summarizes it well. And well, my interest is also how
non-compliant would be for another Python implementation to act
differently, specifically to skip wrapping an except handler body in
try-finally (i.e., go back to Python2 behavior). I'm keen to add such
an option to my fork of MicroPython.

I don't think anyone *likes* the current behaviour. Speaking for myself, 
I think it is definitely a wart on the language, but a justifiable one, 
since the alternative is worse.

So yes, it is strange, and is something that Python programmers have to 
learn. Probably through experience.

I don't understand what this means. What is "clearing an except target"? 
Do you mean deleting the target name? Names are either bound to an 
object, or they aren't bound at all, so I don't know what it means to 
"clear" a name if it doesn't mean delete it.

It isn't an emulation of lexical scope at all. Only the exception target 
is deleted, not other variables bound inside the block.

But a better question is, why would you (generic, not you personally) 
imagine that, alone out of all flow control statements, ONLY "except" 
clauses introduce a new scope? Every other flow control statement (for, 
while, if, elif, else, try, with) runs in the current scope. The only 
statements which create a new scope are def and class. (Did I miss any?)

Wouldn't that mean that MicroPython suffers from the exception/traceback 
reference cycle problem? How do you propose to solve that?

Setting it to None before unbinding it. It's apparently not enough to
say "del e" - you have to do "e = None; del e". Check the OP.

Because there is a reason for such code.

See issue1631942 [1] and the thread with the subject "self-contained 
exceptions" on the Python-3000 mailing list [2] for the rationale.

In short, the code

     try:
         1/0
     except Exception as e:
         del e

should work.

I do not see a problem with storing None before deleting a variable. 
This is not a performance critical code, because it is executed only 
when an exception was raised and caught.

To be fair except is already unique in that it /does/ "pseudo-scope" the
binding to the variable. The other obvious comparisons are to for loops
and context managers, both of which bind a value to a name that survives
after the exit of the control flow statement.

Given the reference counting reasons for exceptions *not* to outlive
their control flow statement, they are the "odd man out" in that they
delete the exception after the control statement's body exits. To me,
the natural and intuitive way to do this would be to have the exception
live in its own scope where it shadows existing variables, rather than
replacing and then completely removing them. The way it works now is
halfway between the behavior of existing control flow statements and
having a proper nested scope.

Not saying that anything has to change - in the end this is one of the
more minor "gotchas" about Python, and there may be practical reasons
for leaving it as it is - but I do think it's worth noting that for many
people this /will/ be surprising behavior, even if you know that
exceptions don't survive outside of the "except" block.

But obviously not, because the code was specifically written to set it
to None first. It's not the sort of thing that can be done
accidentally, is it?

Subject: [Python-Dev] Return type of datetime subclasses added to

Message-ID: <bb5120e0-159e-106d-04c6-2a15f7398966@ganssle.io>

I can think of many reasons why datetime is different from builtins,
though to be honest I'm not sure that consistency for its own sake is
really a strong argument for keeping a counter-intuitive behavior - and
to be honest I'm open to the idea that /all/ arithmetic types /should/
have some form of this change.

That said, I would say that the biggest difference between datetime and
builtins (other than the fact that datetime is /not/ a builtin, and as
such doesn't necessarily need to be categorized in this group), is that
unlike almost all other arithmetic types, /datetime/ has a special,
dedicated type for describing differences in datetimes. Using your
example of a float subclass, consider that without the behavior of
"addition of floats returns floats", it would be hard to predict what
would happen in this situation:

>>> F(1.2) + 3.4

Would that always return a float, even though F(1.2) + F(3.4) returns an
F? Would that return an F because F is the left-hand operand? Would it
return a float because float is the right-hand operand? Would you walk
the MROs and find the lowest type in common between the operands and
return that? It's not entirely clear which subtype predominates. With
datetime, you have:

datetime - datetime -> timedelta
datetime ? timedelta -> datetime
timedelta ? timedelta -> timedelta

There's no operation between two datetime objects that would return a
datetime object, so it's always clear: operations between datetime
subclasses return timedelta, operations between a datetime object and a
timedelta return the subclass of the datetime that it was added to or
subtracted from.

Of course, the real way to resolve whether datetime should be different
from int/float/string/etc is to look at why this choice was actually
made for those types in the first place, and decide whether datetime is
like them /in this respect/. The heterogeneous operations problem may be
a reasonable justification for leaving the other builtins alone but
changing datetime, but if someone knows of other fundamental reasons why
the decision to have arithmetic operations always create the base class
was chosen, please let me know.

Best,
Paul

Which I read, and they do not explain the assignment of None. The only
reference is that the tracker issue mentions having a test case to
ensure that it's happening, which is further proof that it's
intentional, but still fails to explain *why*.

I think Serhiy is saying that if you delete exc before the except body ends, when the compiled code goes to delete it it will fail. Binding to None guarantees that there is something to delete.

Ahh! Thank you. I interpreted that example as a "this is what it
compiles to", rather than actual source code that might fail. Can we
get this example, suitably annotated, into the documentation
somewhere?

I am not familiar enough with the compiler logic, but would it be possible to optimize this away by detecting whether the bound name has already been deleted during the body of the except statement?

I don't see a reason to document this behavior -- it would be strange if it
*didn't* work.

If we had an opcode to delete a variable but didn't raise if it is unset,
we could use that, but otherwise I see no action needed here.

Let's assume we have

class DT(datetime.datetime): ...
class TD(datetime.timedelta): ...

What is the result type for the following expressions?
DT - datetime
DT - DT
DT + TD
DT + timedelta

I have a feeling that the question has no generic answer.
For *particular* implementation you can override all __add__, __sub__
and other arithmetic operations, and you can do it right now with the
current datetime module implementation.

P.S.
I think inheritance from datetime classes is a very rare thing, 99.99% of
users don't need it.

I don't think datetime and builtins like int necessarily need to be
aligned. But I do see a problem -- the __new__ and __init__ methods defined
in the subclass (if any) should allow for being called with the same
signature as the base datetime class. Currently you can have a subclass of
datetime whose __new__ has no arguments (or, more realistically, interprets
its arguments differently). Instances of such a class can still be added to
a timedelta. The proposal would cause this to break (since such an addition
has to create a new instance, which calls __new__ and __init__). Since this
is a backwards incompatibility, I don't see how it can be done -- and I
also don't see many use cases, so I think it's not worth pursuing further.

Note that the same problem already happens with the .fromordinal() class
method, though it doesn't happen with .fromdatetime() or .now():

>>> class D(datetime.datetime):
...   def __new__(cls): return cls.now()
...
>>> D()
D(2019, 1, 6, 10, 33, 37, 161606)
>>> D.fromordinal(100)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: __new__() takes 1 positional argument but 4 were given
>>> D.fromtimestamp(123456789)

It is not really complicated, the default "difference between two
datetimes" returns a `timedelta`, you can change that by overriding
`__sub__` or `__rsub__` as desired, but there's no reason to think that
the fact that just because DT is a subclass of datetime that it would be
coupled to a specific timedelta subclass *by default*.

Similarly, DT + TD by default will do whatever "datetime" and
"timedelta" do unless you specifically override them. In my proposal,
adding some time to a datetime subclass would return an object of the
datetime subclass, so unless __radd__ or __rsub__ were overriden in
`timedelta`, that's what would happen, the defaults would be (sensibly):

DT - datetime -> timedelta
DT - DT -> timedelta
DT + TD -> DT
DT + timedelta -> timedelta

The only time it would be more complicated is if datetime were defined
like this:

class datetime:
??? TIMEDELTA_CLASS = datetime.timedelta
??? ...

In which case you'd have the same problem you have with float/int/etc
(not a particularly more complicated one. But that's not the case, and
there /is/ one obviously right answer. This is not the case with float
subclasses, because the intuitive rule is "adding together two objects
of the same class gives the same class", which fails when you have two
different subclasses. With datetime, you have "adding a delta type to a
value type returns an object of the value type", which makes perfect
sense, as opposed to "adding a delta type to a value type returns the
base value type, even if the base value type was never used".

Both of these points are addressed in my original post, IIRC, but both
of these arguments cut both ways. Assuming it's true that this is very
rare - the 0.01% of people who /are/ subclassing datetime either don't
care about this behavior or want timedelta arithmetic to return their
subclass. It's rare enough that there should be no problem giving them
what they want.

Similarly, the rarest group - people who are creating datetime
subclasses /and/ want the original behavior - can simply implement
__add__ and __sub__ to get what they want, so there's no real conflict,
it's just a matter of setting a sane default that also solves the
problem that datetime alternate constructors tend to leak their
implementation details because of the arithmetic return type issue.


Best, Paul

This is explained on a discussion on the Python-3000 mailing list. I 
provided a code example which would fail if do not perform such 
assignment. The test, mentioned in the tracker issue, contains similar code.

(Dark) Magic. Live and learn/think. So, we allow user to delete a var,
then recreate it, just to delete again. Thanks for both the hint and
references, Serhiy!

I can only agree with what Chris wrote in the initial reply - it
would nice if there would be an explanation of these tricks somewhere.
I myself wouldn't know a better place than the source code comments.
Well, at least I did trace it to the source code where it's handled.

From CPython's points of view, I might (well, have to) agree. But I was
pretty surprised/disappointed that MicroPython follows the same
routine, I'm glad I now understand ins and outs of the choices made.

I did address this in the original post - the assumption that the
subclass constructor will have the same arguments as the base
constructor is baked into many alternate constructors of datetime. I
acknowledge that this is a breaking change, but it is a small one -
anyone creating such a subclass that /cannot/ handled the class being
created this way would be broken in myriad ways.

We have also in recent years changed several alternate constructors
(including `replace`) to retain the original subclass, which by your
same standard would be a breaking change. I believe there have been no
complaints. In fact, between Python 3.6 and 3.7, the very example you
showed broke:

Python 3.6.6:

>>> class D(datetime.datetime):
...???? def __new__(cls):
...???????? return cls.now()
...
>>> D()
D(2019, 1, 6, 13, 49, 38, 842033)

Python 3.7.2:

>>> class D(datetime.datetime):
...???? def __new__(cls):
...???????? return cls.now()
...
>>> D()
Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
? File "<stdin>", line 3, in __new__
TypeError: __new__() takes 1 positional argument but 9 were given


We haven't seen any bug reports about this sort of thing; what we /have/
been getting is bug reports that subclassing datetime doesn't retain the
subclass in various ways (because people /are/ using datetime
subclasses). This is likely to cause very little in the way of problems,
but it will improve convenience for people making datetime subclasses
and almost certainly performance for people using them (e.g. pendulum
and arrow, which now need to take a slow pure python route in many
situations to work around this problem).

If we're /really/ concerned with this backward compatibility breaking,
we could do the equivalent of:

try:
??? return new_behavior(...)
except TypeError:
??? warnings.warn("The semantics of timedelta addition have "
????????????????? "changed in a way that raises an error in "
????????????????? "this subclass. Please implement __add__ "

To answer this, MicroPython doesn't have reference counting and relies
solely on garbage collection, so breaking cycles early wouldn't have
much effect. Breaking stray links to should-be-dead data structures
might (to allow them to be collected sooner rather than later), but
probably not at the expense of introducing extra entry in the block
stack. (That may seems like breadcrumb saving, but saving a few
percents of overhead in many places is how MicroPython achieves
its promise of programming small embedded systems in a very high level
language.)

Maybe someone can propose a code comment to explain this instead? I agree
that this doesn't need to be explained in the language spec, but I don't
see any harm in a comment where the opcodes are emitted to explain why it
is the way it is .

To help set expectations, the current semantics are not a bug and so the
proposal isn't fixing a bug but proposing a change in semantics.

We very much do care. Because this isn't a bug but a voluntary semantic
change you're proposing to change we can't blindly break people who are
relying on the current semantics. We need to have a justification for those
people as to why we have decided to change the semantics now after all of
these years as well as provide an upgrade path.

Brett,

Thank you for bringing this up, but I think you /may/ have misunderstood
my position - though maybe you understood the thrust and wanted to
clarify for people coming in halfway, which I applaud.

I proposed this change /knowing/ that it was a breaking change - it's
why I brought it to the attention of datetime-SIG and now python-dev -
and I believe that there are several factors that lead this to being a
smaller compatibility problem than it seems.

One such factor is the fact that /many/ other features of `datetime`,
including the implementation of `datetime.now()` are /already broken/ in
the current implementation for anyone who would be broken by this
particular aspect of the semantic change. That is not saying that it's
impossible that there is code out there that will break if this change
goes through, it's just saying that the scope of the breakage is
necessarily very limited.

The reason I brought up the bug tracker is because between Python 3.6
and Python 3.7, we in fact made a similar breaking change to the one I'm
proposing here without thinking that anyone might be relying on the fact
that they could do something like:

class D(datetime.datetime):
??? def __new__(cls):
??????? return cls.now()

My point was that there have been no bug reports about the /existing
change/ that Guido was bringing up (his example itself does not work on
Python 3.7!), which leads me to believe that few if any people are
relying on the fact that it is possible to define a datetime subclass
with a different default constructor.

As I mentioned, it is likely possible to have a transition period where
this would still work even if the subclassers have not created their own
__add__ method.

There is no way to create a similar deprecation/transition period for
people relying on the fact that `type(datetime_obj + timedelta_obj) ==
datetime.datetime`, but I think this is honestly a sufficiently minor
breakage that the good outweighs the harm. I will note that we have
already made several such changes with respect to alternate constructors
even though technically someone could have been relying on the fact that
`MyDateTime(*args).replace(month=3)` returns a `datetime` object.

This is not to say that we should lightly make the change (hence my
canvassing for opinions), it is just that there is a good amount of
evidence that, practically speaking, no one is relying on this, and in
fact it is likely that people are writing code that assumes that adding
`timedelta` to a datetime subclass returns the original subclass, either
directly or indirectly - I think we're likely to fix more people than we
break if we make this change.

Best,
Paul

OK, I concede your point (and indeed I only tested this on 3.6). If we
could break the backward compatibility for now() we presumably can break it
for this purpose.

Subject: [Python-Dev] python subprocess module to submit a list of slurm
 sbatch jobs,
 each job use multiprocessing.Pool to run simulation on single compute node
 in cluster
Message-ID: <ede904dacb9e40a880f8a8c52c58e463@eng.ua.edu>

Dear Developers,
I have been working on a piece of code development that need your sincere help (three code file attached here).

I use run_slurm.py to use python subprocess module to submit multiple jobs to slurm cluster by invoking a sbatch file with a for loop to reach the following target:

1) create some environmental variables for job_slurm.py to run simulations (values of these environmental variables will change for each job with the for loop)

2) invoke submit_slurm.sh to submit a sbatch job that will run job_slurm.py

3) each job_slurm.py will use python multiprocess.Pool to run parallized simulations on each ./mod_bart.sh exeutable file (will run for a few hours) on a single compute node in cluster using all cores of this compute node

I get the following error all the time, could you provide some insights on how our implementation is wrong to achieve the desired goal:


Exception in thread Thread-3:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Message-ID: <6C486AB80682E24095E3E77A408D68F201499C9AF5@ALA-MBD.corp.ad.wrs.com>

Hi Python Developers,
I'm Brian Kuhl, I've spent about  28 years working with embedded software. Since 2000 I've worked for Wind River. I'm currently a manager of documentation and customer training in our Ottawa, Canada office. Throughout my career I've had an interest in the use of open source software in embedded systems, have ported many libraries to Wind River's flagship product the VxWorks RTOS.

The safe and secure embedded market where VxWorks is the leader is evolving, and devices that use to be made up of multiple processors running multiple operating systems are now being consolidated. Device security and IoT trends mean a device must be more configurable and updateable, and a better host for portable code. In this evolving space our  customers have asked us to add Python support to VxWorks.

Wind River would like cpython to officially support VxWorks.  I've been ask by my colleagues to volunteer as a maintainer for cpython in order to support this effort.  Wind River will also provide the needed buildbot clients required to verify continuing VxWorks support.

Myself and an intern were able to get the majority of Python tests suite passing with a POC last year.
An engineering group in Beijing  have taken that POC and are improving and cleaning up that effort now with the hopes of up-steaming their efforts.

My Chinese colleagues have suggested that the first step to gaining your support would be to summit a PEP detailing the changes?
If you agree, I will proceed with authoring a PEP.

Many thanks in advance for your responses,

Brian


P.S. I can be found on  github (and many other places) as kuhlenough.

Hi Brian,

I am glad that this is happening!

I don't think you need a PEP to motivate your request -- however you need
to submit the upstream patches, work with the CPython buildbot managers
(Victor?) to connect your buildbots, and work with reviewers (Serhiy?) to
get your patches integrated in CPython. Hopefully the patches are small and
focused -- we generally don't take patches that refactor large swaths of
code. It's also better not to submit everything in a single giant patch
(reviewers hate mega-patches). And the patch submitters need to be
responsive when the code review comments are coming.

This is not a one-time effort -- your team will need to be "on call" to
handle VxWorks issues for the foreseeable future (a minimum commitment of 5
years?), and your team members needs to be able to do this in their
capacity as Wind River engineers, not as open source volunteers.

I believe there is a PEP with a list of supported operating systems that
needs to be updated, but I don't recall which one it is -- hopefully you
can track it down with a little Googling. (Or was it the devguide?)

Good luck,

--Guido

Subject: [Python-Dev] AMD64 Windows8.1 Refleaks 3.x buildbot is back to
 green!
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGG3kqX3z_GCeEQNAOa=WVh1Nc9iopZyT305cFztZCAM1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The "AMD64 Windows 8.1 Refleaks 3.x" buildbot (which hunts reference
leaks and memory leaks) was failing on test_asyncio for 1 year:

   https://bugs.python.org/issue32710

It was a leak of a single reference:

   test_aiosend leaked [1, 1, 1] references, sum=3

I tried multiple times since last year (January 2018) to understand
the leak: it didn't make any sense (well, as any bug at the beginning,
no?). I checked several times the complex asyncio code: all transports
are cleanly closed, the event loop is properly closed, etc. The code
looks correct.

After a long sleepness night... I still failed to reproduce the bug
:-( But I succeeded to get a way shorter reproducer script. Thanks to
this script, I was able to loop to get 100 reference leaks instead of
leaking a single reference. Using tracemalloc, I found the faulty
line... but it still didn't make sense to me. After additional several
hours of debug, I found that an overlapped object wasn't released
properly: an asynchronous WSASend().

The problem was when an overlapped WSASend() failed immediately, the
internal buffer was not released, whereas it holds a reference to the
input byte string. **It means that an asyncio send() failure using the
ProactorEventLoop can cause a memory leak**... I'm very surprised that
nobody noticed such **huge** memory leak previously!

The _overlapped bugfix:

https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/a234e148394c2c7419372ab65b773d53a57f3625

Eventually, the "AMD64 Windows 8.1 Refleaks 3.x" buildbot is back to green!

   https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/80

It means that it will be easier and faster to spot reference or memory
leak regressions (specific to Windows, the Gentoo Refleaks buildbot
was already green for several months!).

Since ProactorEventLoop became the default event loop in Python 3.8
(on Windows, it's specific to Windows), I hope that we fixed all most
obvious bugs!

This story also means that any very tiny buildbot failure (a single
test method failure on a single very specific buildbot) can hide a
giant bug ;-) Sadly, we have to fix *all* buildbots failures to find
them... Hopefully, almost all buildbots are green currently.

Hi,

It's a PEP. The process and expectations for platform are explained in
PEP 11, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0011/

If possible it would also be helpful to get SSH access to some VxWorks
machines for core devs. I know that Victor likes to dig into rare corner
cases and help to debug exotic platforms.

That's great!

I would add that many Windows Proactor bugs were found after implementing
sendfile support.
If sendfile is not available for some reason asyncio uses a fallback to
send a file content chunk-by-chunk reading it in memory.
The fallback code was easy and straightforward, it worked just fine on
Linux but the same code failed on proactor.

Thank you very much, Victor, for finally pinning the problem down.

Subject: Re: [Python-Dev] VxWorks and cpython?

Hi Brian,

I am glad that this is happening!

I don't think you need a PEP to motivate your request -- however you need to submit the upstream patches, work with the CPython buildbot managers (Victor?) to connect your buildbots, and work with reviewers (Serhiy?) to get your patches integrated in CPython. Hopefully the patches are small and focused -- we generally don't take patches that refactor large swaths of code. It's also better not to submit everything in a single giant patch (reviewers hate mega-patches). And the patch submitters need to be responsive when the code review comments are coming.

This is not a one-time effort -- your team will need to be "on call" to handle VxWorks issues for the foreseeable future (a minimum commitment of 5 years?), and your team members needs to be able to do this in their capacity as Wind River engineers, not as open source volunteers.

I believe there is a PEP with a list of supported operating systems that needs to be updated, but I don't recall which one it is -- hopefully you can track it down with a little Googling. (Or was it the devguide?)

Good luck,

--Guido

Hi Python Developers,
I?m Brian Kuhl, I?ve spent about  28 years working with embedded software. Since 2000 I?ve worked for Wind River. I?m currently a manager of documentation and customer training in our Ottawa, Canada office. Throughout my career I?ve had an interest in the use of open source software in embedded systems, have ported many libraries to Wind River?s flagship product the VxWorks RTOS.

The safe and secure embedded market where VxWorks is the leader is evolving, and devices that use to be made up of multiple processors running multiple operating systems are now being consolidated. Device security and IoT trends mean a device must be more configurable and updateable, and a better host for portable code. In this evolving space our  customers have asked us to add Python support to VxWorks.

Wind River would like cpython to officially support VxWorks.  I?ve been ask by my colleagues to volunteer as a maintainer for cpython in order to support this effort.  Wind River will also provide the needed buildbot clients required to verify continuing VxWorks support.

Myself and an intern were able to get the majority of Python tests suite passing with a POC last year.
An engineering group in Beijing  have taken that POC and are improving and cleaning up that effort now with the hopes of up-steaming their efforts.

My Chinese colleagues have suggested that the first step to gaining your support would be to summit a PEP detailing the changes?
If you agree, I will proceed with authoring a PEP.

Many thanks in advance for your responses,

Brian

The best case to get a full support is to have one core developer
responsible of handling all bugs specific to the platform.

As a core developer, I'm never comfortable to merge a change specific
to a platform if I'm not able to validate it manually myself. I trust
no one, not even myself (I know well that I do frequently mistakes!),
so I prefer to always double check changes before merging them ;-)

In the meanwhile, I would say that we can only offer "best effort"
support. Fix reports bugs and do our best in our limited time.

Someone has to take the work done to port Python on VxWorks and write
small pull requests. These PRs should be reviewed one by one to make
sure that it's the correct way to fix an issue. Be prepared that it
can take several months even if all these changes look obvious to
*you*. Core developers have limited time and many prefer to focus on
the platforms that they are using, not worry about a platform they
never heard about... I can have a look at such PRs.

It would also help to have a documentation somewhere about "Python on
VxWorks". Pointers to VxWorks (general info, developers info),
pointers to your port, current status of the port, etc.

Victor

It feels like it would be a good idea for Brian or someone else from
Wind River to work towards becoming a core developer? If Brian, et al
are interested, is there a core developer who would be willing to
mentor them?

Hi Victor,
I think we can come up with some sort of strategy that will work for everyone. 
I'll ask about the SSH access; and if that runs up against a corporate roadblock, I will explore some other alternative. 

Is there a good place to document "Python on VxWorks" ?
The changes to Python are not large, I've kept the pull request from last year's POC active. The changed files provide a good summary of the scope.
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/4184/files
However, based on the POC we've gone back and improved VxWorks, so the some of the uglier bits, in libraries like submodule, won't be needed.
These will be in the next release of VxWorks. 

However we let automake and setup.py do much of the work for us, so where VxWorks  does not have support for something, it's not obvious.
A public document would go a long way to filling in those details, something much more detailed than  my glib "VxWorks is almost POSIX" in the pull request.  

Other challenges; 
* VxWorks is cross-compiled on both Linux and Windows. ( currently with clang and gcc)
* Supported on ARM,  PowerPC and Intel processors
* 32bit and 64bit builds 
* A constantly evolving set of reference boards (or BSPs)   
https://marketplace.windriver.com/index.php?bsp&on=list&type=platform&value=VxWorks:%207%20-%20Wind%20River%20Workbench%204.0

I don't think we need a buildbot for every board.  I'm thinking a 1/2 dozen to cover ARM, PPC and IA with both a 32bit and 64 bit build?
We have a bit of chicken and egg problem right now, a buildbot will always fail until there's some basic VxWorks support added. 

Do we set them up, and just let them fail, till enough PRs are accepted to make it build?

Brian

Anywhere. If you don't know, you might use
https://wiki.python.org/moin/ ... But I'm not sure that the wiki is
still widely used. Many pages may be outdated.

That's a giant PR. Sorry, I'm unable to review that. Usually, I simply
ignore such PR.

Cross-compilation is complex. So yeah, any documentation is more than
welcome. Many people are still fighting to try to get a working Python
on Android... My notes:
https://pythondev.readthedocs.io/android.html
(is there still someone working on that?)

> Other challenges;

I don't think that it should be an issue for Python. Very few parts of
CPython are architecture specific. I'm aware of ctypes which is more
or less optional. ctypes rely on libffi which supports a wide range of
architectures.

> * 32bit and 64bit builds

We have a wide range of 32 and 64 bits buildbot workers. I don't
expect any issue here.

Which C compiler do you use?

> https://marketplace.windriver.com/index.php?bsp&on=list&type=platform&value=VxWorks:%207%20-%20Wind%20River%20Workbench%204.0

I'm not sure how it's supposed to impact Python?

> I don't think we need a buildbot for every board.  I'm thinking a 1/2 dozen to cover ARM, PPC and IA with both a 32bit and 64 bit build?
> We have a bit of chicken and egg problem right now, a buildbot will always fail until there's some basic VxWorks support added.

No please. A *single* buildbot worker in total is enough. When you
will have a very good support and a full test suite coverage, we can
discuss about adding more flavors.

> Do we set them up, and just let them fail, till enough PRs are accepted to make it build?

Multiple buildbot workers are failing since many years. *I* would
prefer to see the full test suite passing (even if some tests are
skipped on your platform) before adding a buildbot, but it seems like
some people have a different opinion on that. For example, there is an
AIX buildbot and some tests are still failing (it was always red,
failing, no?).

You're right that it's a chicken-and-egg issue, except that we don't
have a very strong policy for buildbots.

Note: I cannot promise that I will review your PR. I can only promise
that I will have a look :-) VxWorks is not really a priority for me.
(I prefer to not give false promise here.)

To prepare this PR for review the following changes are required:

* Update it to the current master. Currently there are many conflicts.
* Remove unrelated changes, like: adding/removing empty lines, 
adding/removing spaces in unrelated lines.
* Remove unrelated changes in 'configure'. It depends on the used 
version of autoconf.
* Ensure that you do not use tabs, unless they are necessary (in Makefile).
* Make the code conforming PEP 7 and PEP 8. In particular, spaces should 
be added between 'if' and '(', between ')' and '{', opening '{' should 
be on the same line for statements, but on a new line if it is defines a 
function body, parenthesis around conditions of 'if' and 'while' are not 
needed in Python, long lines should be wrapped, etc, etc.

(tangent) For those that are curious, I went and looked this up [1],
and the current PSF board has 2 of 11 members being core devs, whereas
the early days of the board look like they had a ratio that was more
often on the order of 4-6 core devs out of 7 members.

I take that as a sign of healthy community growth :)

Michael Felt has been working towards getting that AIX bot green, and
I merged several PRs over the end of year break to help make progress
towards that goal.

He hit a similar challenge to the one Brian will be facing: putting
all the changes in one PR can make it overwhelming to review (so the
PR stalls), but splitting them up into individual PRs can result in
changes that don't appear sufficiently well motivated on their own (so
those PRs also stall).

The AIX case is currently an example where some of the buildbot
"fixes" are actually test skips, as the goal is to get to a point
where "things that currently work on AIX keep working, while folks
interested in AIX can work towards getting the not-working things
indicated by skipped tests also working".

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Thanks - come a long way with getting tests resolved!
Message-ID: <7d5a4f47-0c56-020e-1857-184bf78bc858@felt.demon.nl>

Many thanks to all who assisted with feedback. Back at the start of
August my make tests had a nasty block like this:

29 tests failed:
??? test__xxsubinterpreters test_array test_asyncio test_cmath
??? test_compile test_complex test_ctypes test_distutils test_embed
??? test_float test_fractions test_getargs2 test_httplib
??? test_httpservers test_imaplib test_importlib test_math test_poplib
??? test_shutil test_signal test_socket test_ssl test_statistics
??? test_strtod test_struct test_subprocess test_time test_timeout
??? test_utf8_mode

And now that is down to:


4 tests failed:
test_eintr test_importlib test_multiprocessing_forkserver
test_multiprocessing_spawn
While I am still trying to figure out where the "multiprocessing" errors
come from - there is
only one "test" left from the original list - and that one, plus
test_eintr have PR's waiting for your approval.
I could not have gotten this far without help!
Sincerely,
Michael aka aixtools
