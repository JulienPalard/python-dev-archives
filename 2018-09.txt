Hey Everyone! 

   I am new to this mailing list. I have experience with software development in the medical device industry and SaaS technology solutions. I have primarily worked with R, Java, and various unique and specific machine languages, but I have recently picked up Python. 
   Part of what has brought me to this mailing list was my search for insights on Python?s usability as a shareable, executable, desktop application. I often make tools for streamlining my professional tasks and decided I wanted to give Python a try. I have read that there are some fantastic GUI libraries and development environments, but how practical is this language for distributing those programs in a nicely packaged exe? 
    If there is anyone here with some insight I would love to start off my membership with a discussion and some knowledge sharing!

Best,
Kevin

Hi, Kevin! This mailing list is actually about the development *of* Python,
not *with* it. To have a discussion about GUI programming with Python is
probably python-list is a better place to discuss this.

I work in "parallel"
/data/prj/python/python-version
/data/prj/python/git/python-version

I suppose I should try setting GITDIR - but, I think it would be better,
at least nicer, if "patchcheck" as a target did some checking for git
early on, rather than bail out at the end. The results of the check
might be just a message to set GITDIR, e.g..

I'll give this a try next time around. (vacation, so not really 'active'
atm).

Thanks for the suggestions.

Oh!  I?m so sorry haha. I thought this was a developers forum for users of Python. So you are saying Python-list would be that type of forum?

Yep, python-list sounds like the mailing list that you're after.

given that people are starting to quote enthusiastically the comments you

I do think that adding a ?Cython-lite? tool the CPython distribution would be less ideal, creating and maintaining that tool would be a lot of work without clear benefits over just using Cython.

That's their plan. Saying that "it will" is a bit premature at this point.
The list of failed attempts at writing static Python compilers is rather
long, even if you only count those that compile the usual "easy subset" of
Python.

I wish them the best of luck and endurance, but they have a long way to go.

That's not "the first goal". It's the /only/ goal. The only intention of
mypyc is to be able to compile and optimise enough of Python to speed up
the kind or style of code that mypy uses.


> Essentially, mypyc will be similar

Which is bad, right? It means that there will be many things that simply
don't work, and that you need to change your code in order to make it
compile at all. Cython is way beyond that point by now. Even RPython will
probably continue to be way better than mypyc for quite a while, maybe
forever, who knows.


> Interfacing with C libraries can be easily achieved with cffi.

Except that it will be fairly slow. cffi is not designed for static
analysis but for runtime operations. You can obviously also use cffi from
Cython ? but then, why would you, if you can get much faster code much more
easily without using cffi?

That being said, if someone wants to write a static cffi optimiser for
Cython, why not, I'd be happy to help with my advice. The cool thing is
that this can be improved gradually, because compiling the cffi code
probably already works out of the box. It's just not (much) faster than
when interpreted.

So does normal (non-subset) Python code. You can run it in PyPy, have
CPython interpret it, or compile it with Cython if you want it to run
faster in CPython, all without having to limit yourself to a subset of
Python. Seriously, you make this sound like requiring users to rewrite
their code to make it compilable with mypyc was a good thing.


> They can even apply some optimizations to it eventually, as
> it has a strict and static type system.

In case "they" refers to PyPy here, then I remember the PyPy project
stating very clearly that they are not interested in PEP-484 typing because
it is completely irrelevant for their JIT. It's really best for them to
ignore it.

That's similar for Cython, simply because PEP-484 typing isn't designed for
optimisation at all, definitely not for C-level optimisation. Still, Cython
can make some use of PEP-484 typing, if you use it to define specific C
types. That allows normal execution in CPython, static analysis with
PEP-484 analyser tools (e.g. PyCharm or mypy), and efficient optimisation
by Cython. The best of all worlds. See the docs on how to do that, it's
been supported for about a year now (and has been around in a similar,
non-PEP-484 form for years before that PEP even existed).

You are free to improve the documentation or otherwise help us find and
discuss concrete problems with it. Calling Cython a "poorly documented
language" could easily feel offensive towards those who have put a lot of
work into the documentation, wiki, tutorials, trainings and what not that
help people use the language. Even stack overflow is getting better and
better in documenting Cython these days, even though responses over there
that describe work-arounds tend to get outdated fairly quickly.

Besides, don't forget that it's Python, so consider reading the Python
documentation first if something is unclear. And maybe some documentation
of C data types as well. (.5 wink)

Why not? You didn't actually give any reasons for that.

I don't understand that argument. What's wrong about using a tool that
helps you get around writing boiler plate code? The actual testing does not
need to be done by Cython at all, you can write it any way you like.

https://bugs.python.org/issue30672 is the open issue noting that it
should also handle the case where POSIX isn't a simple alias for the C
locale the way it is in glibc.

UTF-8 mode relates to PEP 540, and the intent is that the default
C/POSIX locale should either be coerced to a UTF-8 based one (by the
PEP 538 mechanism), or else UTF-8 mode will activate, and CPython will
set its *own* encoding to UTF-8, and ignore the locale one.

We did need to make the PEP 538 tests AIX-aware [1] so they knew what
to expect as the default encoding when locale coercion was disabled,
so it's possible some further special casing will be needed in the
UTF-8 mode tests as well.

Cheers,
Nick.

Hello.

   This mailing list is to work on developing Python (adding new
features to Python itself and fixing bugs); if you're having problems
learning, understanding or using Python, please find another forum.
Probably python-list/comp.lang.python mailing list/news group is the
best place; there are Python developers who participate in it; you may
get a faster, and probably more complete, answer there. See
https://www.python.org/community/ for other lists/news groups/fora.
Thank you for understanding.

Dear all,

Have we tried cipher implementation includes AES as a standard library in
the past?

if possible I want to try to implement AES because famous 3rd party library
is not maintained and general cipher programs should be used for multiple

In my case, I want to use AES implementation for zipfile module.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Heap-allocated StructSequences
Message-ID: <EA6CC3C2-A371-4F24-AF5C-4401B57ED487@fb.com>

PEP-384 talks about defining a Stable ABI by making PyTypeObject opaque. Thus, banning the use of static PyTypeObjects.

Specifically, I?d like to focus on those static PyTypeObjects that are initialized as StructSequences. As of today, there are 14 instances of these types (in timemodule.c, posixmodule.c, etc.) within cpython/Modules. These are all initialized through PyStructSequence_InitType2. This is very problematic when trying to make these types conform to PEP-384 as they are used through static PyTypeObjects.

Problems:

  *   PyStructSequence_InitType2 overrides the PyTypeObject:

This C-API does a direct memcpy from a ?prototype? structure. This effectively overrides anything set within the PyTypeObject. For example, if we were to initialize a heap allocated PyTypeObject and pass it on to this function, the C-API would just get rid of the Py_TPFLAG_HEAPTYPE flag, causing issues with the GC.


  *   PyStructSequence_InitType2 does not work with heap allocated PyTypeObjects:

Even if the function is fixed to preserve the state of the PyTypeObject and only overriding the specific slots (i.e. tp_new, tp_repr, etc.), it is expected that PyStructSequence_InitType2 will call PyType_Ready on the object. That means that the incoming object shouldn?t be initialized by a function such as PyType_FromSpec, as that would have already called PyType_Ready on it. Therefore, PyStructSequence_InitType2 will now have the responsibility of setting all the slots and properties of the PyHeapTypeObject, which is not feasible.


  *   PyStructSequence_NewType is non-functional:

This function was meant to be used as a way of creating a heap-allocated PyTypeObject that be passed to PyStructSequence_InitType2, effectively returning a heap allocated PyTypeObject. The current implementation doesn?t work in practice. Given that this struct is created in the heap, the GC has control over it. Thus, when the GC tries to traverse the type it complains with: ?Error: type_traverse() called for non-heap type?, since it doesn?t have the Py_TPFLAG_HEAPTYPE flag. If we add the flag, we run into bullet point 1, if we are able to preserve the flag then we will still run into the problem of bullet point 2. Extra note: This C-API is not being used anywhere within CPython itself.

Solution:

  *   Fix the implementation of PyStructSequence_NewType:

The best solution would be to fix the implementation of this function. This can easily be done by dynamically creating a PyType_Spec and calling PyType_FromSpec

```

PyObject*

PyStructSequence_NewType(PyStructSequence_Desc *desc)

{

    // ?

    PyType_Spec* spec = PyMem_NEW(PyType_Spec, 1);

    spec->name = desc->name;

    spec->basicsize = sizeof(PyStructSequence) - sizeof(PyObject *);

    spec->itemsize = sizeof(PyObject *);

    spec->flags = Py_TPFLAGS_DEFAULT;

    spec->slots = PyMem_NEW(PyType_Slot, 6);

    spec->slots[0].slot = Py_tp_dealloc;

    spec->slots[0].pfunc = (destructor)structseq_dealloc;

    // ?

    bases = PyTuple_Pack(1, &PyTuple_Type);

   type = PyType_FromSpecWithBases(spec, bases);

    // ?

```



This will cleanly create a heap allocated PyStructSequence which can be used just like any stack allocated PyTypeObject initialized through PyStructSequence_InitType2. This means that any C-Extension should be using PyStructSequence_NewType and only built-in types should be calling PyStructSequence_InitType2. This will enable these types to comply with PEP-384


As an extra, I already have patches for this proposal. They can be found here:

To everyone reading this thread please keep in mind that I'm not in
position to "defend" mypyc or to "promote" it, and I'm not affiliated
with the project at all.  I am just excited about yet another tool to
statically compile Python and I'm discussing it only from a
theoretical standpoint.

To be clear I'm not involved with mypyc, but my understanding is that
the entire Python syntax will be supported, except some dynamic
features like patching `globals()`, `locals()`, or classes, or
__class__.  IMO this is *good* and in general Python programs don't do
that anyways.

Could you please clarify this point?  My current understanding is that
you can build a static compiler with a knowledge about cffi so that it
can compile calls like `ffi.new("something_t[]", 80)` to pure C.

The "much more easily" part is debatable here and is highly
subjective.  For me using Cython is also easier *at this point*
because I've spent so much time working with it. Although getting
there wasn't easy for me :(

Yeah, statically compiling cffi-enabled code is probably the way to go
for mypyc and Cython.

But that's the point: unless you add Cython types to your Python code
it gets only moderate speedups.  Using Cython/C types usually means
that you need to use pxd/pyx files which means that the code isn't
Python anymore.  I know that Cython has a mode to use decorators in
pure Python code to annotate types, but they are less intuitive than
using typing annotations in 3.6+.

Didn't mean to offend anyone, sorry if I did.  I'm myself partly

I've listed a couple:

(1) To get significant speedup one needs to learn a lot of new syntax.
For CPython it means that we'd have Python, C, and Cython to learn to
understand code written in Cython.  There's a very popular assumption
that you have to be proficient in C in order to become a CPython core
dev and people are genuinely surprised when I tell them that it's not
a requirement.  At the three conferences I've been this summer at
least 5 people complained to me that they didn't even consider
contributing to CPython because they don't know C. Adding yet another
language would simply raise this bar even higher, IMHO.

(2) My point about documentation still stands, even though I feel
extremely uncomfortable using it, sorry.

Because you don't have 100% control over how exactly Cython (or
different versions of it) will compile your code to C.  In my
experience writing a few C API tests in C is relatively easy compared
to introducing these new C APIs in the first place.

To summarize my personal position:

I'm -1 on using Cython to write C API tests/boilerplate in CPython.

I'm -1 on giving green light to use Cython's pxd/pyx syntaxes in CPython.

I'd be +0.5 on using Cython (optionally?) to compile some pure Python
code to make it 30-50% faster.  asyncio, for instance, would certainly
benefit from that.

The Python standard library doesn't contain any encryption, signing, and
other cryptographic algorithms for multiple reasons. The only exception
from the rule are hashing algorithms and HMAC construct. There are legal
implications like export restrictions. Crypto is just too hard to get
right and we don't want to give the user additional rope. We already had
a very lengthy and exhausting discussion for the secrets module. That
module just provides a user-friendly interface to CPRNG.

By the way, AES by itself is a useless to borderline dangerous
algorithm. It must be embedded within additional layers like block mode,
authenticated encryption / MAC, and more. There isn't a single correct
answer for block mode and AD algorithm, too. It highly depends on the
problem space. While GCM AEAD mode is good choice for network
communication, it can be a pretty bad idea for persistent storage.

There is one excellent Python library with high level and low level
cryptographic algorithms: http://cryptography.readthedocs.io/ . It's t

No, that's not the goal, at least from what I understood from my
discussions with Jukka. The goal is to make it compile mypy, be it by
supporting Python features in mypyc or by avoiding Python features in mypy.
I'm sure they will take any shortcut they can in order to avoid having to
make mypyc too capable, because mypyc is not more than a means to an end.
For example, they may easily get away without supporting generators and
closures, which are quite difficult to implement in C. But finding a
non-trivial piece of Python code out there that uses neither of the two is
probably not easy.

I'm also sure they will avoid Python semantics wherever they can, because
implementing them in the same way as CPython and Cython would mean that
certain constructs cannot safely be statically reasoned about, and thus
cannot be optimised. Avoiding (full) Python semantics relieves you from
these restrictions, and if you control both sides, the compiler and the
code that it compiles, then it becomes much easier to apply arbitrary
optimisations at will.

IMHO, what they are implementing is much closer to ShedSkin than to Cython.

I'm sure there is a relatively large subset of cffi's API that could be
compiled statically, as long as the declartions and their usage are kept
simple and fully visible to the compiler. What that subset is remains to be
seen once someone actually tries to do it.

I doubt it, given the expected restrictions and verbosity. But debating
this is useless as long as no-one attempts to actually write a static
compiler for cffi(-like) code.

I'm aware that this is a very common misconception that is difficult to get
out of people's heads. You probably got this idea from wrapping a native
library, in which case the only choice you have in order to declare an
external C-API is really to use Cython's special syntax. However, this
would not apply to most use cases in the CPython project context, and it
also does not necessarily apply to most of the code in a Cython module even
if it uses external libraries.

Cython has four ways to provide type declarations: cdef statements in
Cython code, external .pxd files for Python or Cython files, special
decorators and declaration functions, and PEP-484/526 type annotations.

All four have their use cases (e.g. syntax support in different Python
versions, efficiency of expression, readability for people with different
backgrounds, etc.), and all but the first allow users to keep their module
code in Python syntax. As long as you do not call into external native
code, it's your choice which of these you prefer for your code base,
project context and developer background. You can even mix them at will, if
you feel like it.

You can use PEP-484/526 type annotations to declare Cython types in Python
code that you intend to compile. It's entirely up to you, and it's an
entirely subjective measure which "is better". Many people prefer Cython's
non-Python syntax because it allows them to apply their existing C
knowledge. For them, PEP-484 annotations may easily be non-intuitive in
comparison.

Adding the right language would lower the bar, IMHO. Cython is Python. It
allows users with a Python background to implement C things without having
to thoroughly learn C /and/ the CPython C-API first. So, the way I see it,
rather than /adding/ a "third" language to the mix, it substantially lowers
the entry level from the current two and a half languages (Python + C +
C-API) to one and a half (Python + Cython).

Since most of this (stdlib) Python code doesn't need to stay syntax
compatible with Python < 3.6 (actually 3.8) anymore, you can probably get
much higher speedups than that by statically typing some variables and
functions here and there. I recently tried that with difflib, makes a big
difference.

As somebody who only has light exposure to C, I would very much like to have Cython be an option.

Great to hear that PEP 484 type annotations are supported.  Here's a
link to the docs:
https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html#static-typing

Yeah, but if we decide to use Cython in CPython we probably need to
come up with something like PEP 7 to recommend one particular style
and have an overall guideline.  Using PEP 484 annotations means that
we have pure Python code that PyPy and other interpreters can still
run.

I'd be willing to try this in asyncio if we start using Cython.

Message-ID: <CA+3bQGHXdQih-RYBR3y9sN7NANB6YT_7ZaN=NpVYfSFyx-8y5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It's no longer possible to merge any change in the 3.6 branch of
CPython, because the AppVeyor job fails:
https://bugs.python.org/issue34575

It seems like AppVeyor has a build cache and this cache is outdated. I
tried to use the REST API but I'm not allowed to invalidate the cache:
even the most basic REST API query (list my own roles) fails with:

{"message":"You do not have required permissions to perform this action."}

Who ows the "python" AppVeyor project? Can someone please give me the
administrator permission on this project, so I will be able to invalid
the build cache?

Moreover, would it be possible to give me the administrator permission
on the CPython GitHub project, so I would be able to mark the AppVeyor
as optional until the issue is solved (to unblock the workflow at
least)? I promise I will not mess up the Python project ;-)

Thanks in advance,
Victor

Hi,

Someone asked somewhere (oops, I forgot where!) when is Python 3.7.1
scheduled. I wanted to reply when I saw that it was scheduled for 2
months ago:

"3.7.1: 2018-07-xx"
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/#maintenance-releases

Is there any blocker for 3.7.1? I fixed dozens of bugs in the 3.7
branch since 3.7.0 has been released. I'm ashamed of most of them,
since I introduced regressions in 3.7. (If you insist, I can name them
;-))

Note: the latest Python activity of Ned Deily, our 3.7 release
manager, was an email sent to python-committers mi-July.

I don't appear to have admin rights on Appveyor either. Also, there
doesn't appear to be an appveyor.yml file in the CPython repository,
so I'm not clear how the build process has been configured. Does
anyone have that information? (And I'd strongly recommend that if
we're somehow configuring the builds via the Appveyor UI, we move to
using a config file like we do for Travis, so that diagnosis and fixes
can be done without needing to access the Appveyor admin interface...)

Hello everyone,

According to the [doc][1], `collections.Counter` convenience intersection
and union functions are meant to help it represent multisets. However, it
currently lacks comparisons, which would make sense and seems
straightforward to implement.
Am I missing something here or should I send a PR ASAP?? :-)

Cheers,

For some reason it seems to be located in a hidden directory
(".github/appveyor.yml").  Not the most intuitive decision IMHO.
Travis' own config file ".travis.yml" is still at repository root, which
makes things more confusing.

Agreed. I have at least one dataclasses bug I'm planning on addressing,

Thanks, agreed that's confusing. I'd prefer appveyor.yml to be at the
project root, as that's what nearly all projects I deal with do. But
at least I know where it is now :-)

I've just made the "continuous-integration/appveyor/pr" status check
optional on the 3.6 branch to unblock the development for now.

Indeed, AppVeyor's REST API doesn't work:

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $APPVEYOR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type:
application/json" -X DELETE
https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/python/cpython/buildcache
{"message":"You do not have required permissions to perform this action."}

I'm going to try to make you an admin on python/cpython, but I find
GitHub's user/team management UI a bit confusing, so no promise :)

I've attempted to make a change that should give you both more access;
even odds on whether it did anything :).  I've never tried to use
their REST API, so I don't know whether it will help with that at all.

The idea there was to avoid proliferation of root-level dotfiles where
possible, but if we would rather keep it at the project root it's a
relatively simple change to make.

For the actual issue at hand, the problem arises from doing builds on
3.6 with both the VS2015 and VS2017 images.  Apparently something
built in `/externals` by the VS2015 build gets cached, which then
breaks the VS2017 build; I haven't tracked down how exactly that is
happening.  I think the preferred solution is probably to just drop
the VS2017 build on 3.6 on AppVeyor; VSTS runs on VS2017 and dropping
one of the builds from 3.6 will make AppVeyor significantly quicker on
that branch.

Do we have a VS2017 buildbot on the 3.6 branch? If yes, I vote to drop
VS2017 in the pre-commit hook (AppVeyor) since it would make AppVeyor
twice faster on 3.6!

Based on https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/08/02/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/,
that seems plausible to me, since they're adding a true pseudo-tty
system, and mostly modeling it's behaviour on the *nix one.

I do indeed now seem to have admin access on Appveyor. Thanks for
that. I guess I should therefore say that if anyone needs help with
Appveyor stuff, feel free to ping me and save Zach from getting all
the work :-)

When working via github on the web (which I was) rather than on a
local checkout where I can search, putting it in a subdiretory is a
bit less discoverable (made worse because there's nothing about the
name ".github" that suggests it would have Appveyor files in it :-))
I'd prefer it at the top level - but not enough to submit a PR for
that at the moment, so I'm fine with it staying where it is.

Nice catch. I'd agree, it's probably not worth having both
(particularly as, if Victor says, we have buildbots for the one
Appveyor doesn't cover - but even if we don't I think VSTS has it
covered).

I presume you're suggesting keeping 2017 is so that we don't have
stray 2015-built artifacts in the cache, which makes sense to me, and
I have a mild preference for keeping the latest compiler, as that's
likely the one that people will find easier to get. But 2015 is
presumably the version the official 3.6 builds are made with, so
there's an argument for keeping that one (although if we do that I
guess we need to find a *different* way of fixing the cached artifact
issue).

tl; dr; I'm inclined to agree with you that just using VS2017 on
Appveyor is the simplest option.

My fix was actually to keep VS2015 on AppVeyor and leave VS2017 to
VSTS, that way we get pre-commit coverage on both compilers.  There
shouldn't be any caching issues between branches, since PCbuild is
sufficiently different between each branch.  I wish there was a cache
per branch, but there doesn't seem to be.

Hello,

Let me take this note as an opportunity to nag that I have a still
open pull request to add testing of Python on Cygwin to the AppVeyor
build, which in theory works quite well:
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8463
So +1 for dropping one build configuration from AppVeyor if that will
make it easier in the future to add this one :)

However, Victor has asked that as a prerequisite to adding a Cygwin
build to AppVeyor, we first have a relatively stable buildbot.  I had
thought maybe adding advisory CI on AppVeyor *first* would make
getting a stable buildbot easier, but I can see the argument either
way, so we have added said buildbot:
https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/164   Unfortunately, for
the last ~120 builds it has been all but useless due to at least two
small, but long outstanding issues preventing 3.7.x from building on
Cygwin.  Both of those issues have proposed fixes pending review, both
of which have PRs linked to from my AppVeyor PR.

If anyone is interested in having a look at those I'd appreciate it,
thanks  (one of them also got some review from Inada Naoki, but we
didn't ever agree on some concrete action items for making the patch
acceptable, and it has stalled again...)

Best,
E

The Python standard library doesn't have to solve all problems. Although
the slogan is "Batteries Included", we stopped including all batteries a
long time. We try not to add new modules, especially complex and
security-relevant modules like a generic crypto interface. The Python
core developer team doesn't have any resources to design, create, and
maintain a crypto interface.

The ssl module is a bit special, because pip and other download tools
need it. Without the ssl module, pip wouldn't be able to download
packages over HTTPS.

If you need cryptographic algorithms and primitives, then use the PyCA
cryptography package. It's *the* recommended library for cryptography,
and X.509.

Christian,  really appreciated the details. I understood.

Is wrapper library like ssl module with openssl on platform also not good
idea?
My intention is not re-invention but single standard way as standard
library.

If I can read past discussion somewhere, it's also appreciated

Thanks and Regards,

Sorry, allow me to ask one more thing.
If I want to use AES in zipfile module, what the good way to implement?

Oh, thanks, I had missed that. I guess I can live with it, although I agree
with [the last comment][1] that this decision does not make a lot of sense.
But hey, who am I to second-guess Guido anr Raymond H.

This was on purpose as the CI files are not directly related to Python
itself so they are easier to leave out of any source tarball and such. The
reason .travis.yml is top-level is because Travis won't let us have it
anywhere else.

Subject: [Python-Dev] We cannot fix all issues: let's close XML security
 issues (not fix them)
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGGoCpiHnHiM4ET-KitSmPTZS5PkSsf2TaZH+p1xQen6TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The Python bug tracker is full of bugs, and sadly we don't have enough
people to take care of all of them. There are 3 open bugs about
security issues in XML and I simply propose to close it:

   https://bugs.python.org/issue17318
   https://bugs.python.org/issue17239
   https://bugs.python.org/issue24238

The XML documentation already starts with a red warning explaining the
security limitations of the Python implementation and points to
defusedxml and defusedexpat which are existing and working
counter-measures:

   https://docs.python.org/dev/library/xml.html

Note: Christian Heimes, author of these 2 packages, told me that these
modules may not work on Python 3.7, he didn't have time to maintain
them recently. Maybe someone might want to help him?

I suggest to close the 3 Python bugs without doing anything. Are you
ok with that? Keeping the issue open for 3 years doesn't help anyone,
and there is already a security warning in all supported version (I
checked 2.7 and 3.4).

It seems like XML is getting less popular because of JSON becoming
more popular (even if JSON obviously comes with its own set of
security issues...). It seems like less core developers care about XML
(today than 3 years ago).

We should just accept that core developers have limited availability
and that documenting security issues is an *acceptable* trade-off. I
don't see any value of keeping these 3 issues open.

If we consider fixing these issues to be desirable, then the issues
should be kept open.  Closing issues because no-one is working on them
sounds a bit silly to me.

I forgot to mention that closing these issues is my reply to Larry's
call to fix 3 security issues:

https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-August/006031.html

Larry wrote "If they're really all wontfix, maybe we should mark them
as wontfix, thus giving 3.4 a sendoff worthy of its heroic stature."

For these XML issues, the security vulnerabilities can also been seen
as XML features. Loading an external DTD is part of the XML
specification, as well as entity expansion.

I'm also dubious about PyYAML which allows to run arbitrary Python
code in a configuration *by default*. But well, it seems like nobody
stepped in to change the default.

"wontfix" on 3.4 doesn't mean we won't fix them later, e.g. in 3.8.

That doesn't mean there shouldn't be any hard limits to expansion depth
or breadth.

Function calls are a Python feature, yet we limit the amount of
recursion allowed.

Antoine.

FWIW I'm with Antoine here -- XML is still important and I'd like us to go
the extra mile here, not just give up because the issues have been inactive
for a long time. We can't control what PyYAML does, but for the stdlib XML
code, the buck stops here, and we should do the responsible thing.

no time? i have seen them countless of time on this list e.g. no ... don't
implement this in the workflow as my volunteer time will be lost etc etc
etc. i guess a call for more core contributors will be nice.

for myself i have some translations ahead (finally getting the chance to
read the docs from cover to cover), but i guess actually core-contributing
will be a nice experience.

the problem with getting contributors is that the docs need to be more
readable, more tutos need to be written (less people are contributors /
pyramid effect -> less guides written). the devs are doing a nice job
guiding etc but the first step must be made easier.

lack of time for an exceedingly popular project, for a very open system as
python hints to a bottleneck somehere, not that there are no interests, but
that they get blocked.

If Christian is not able to keep maintaining the defused* packages, then 
I may take a look at this next week at the sprints. The built-in XML 
packages actually don't meet Microsoft's internal security requirements, 
so I have some business motivation to do it. Hopefully it doesn't turn 
me into the sole XML maintainer...

Ultimately, however, I think we're looking at technically incompatible 
design changes, which is why simply dropping in a "fix" for 3.4 would 
not work whereas adding new options (with more secure defaults) may work 
for 3.8.

So I'm agreed with nearly everyone else - bugs should stay open as long 
as we're interested in taking a fix, even if they've already been open 
for a long time. Our issue tracker is a backlog, not a plan, so there is 
no penalty for something sitting in there for a long time.

Cheers,
Steve

Great! The best would be to be able to merge defuse* features into the
stdlib. Maybe not change the default, but add an option to enable
security counter-measures.

Back in the days, I didn't push hard for the necessary fixes, because
all fixes were breaking changes. After all I'd have to disable some
features that people may have relied upon. The XML security stuff was my
first major security topic for Python, even before SipHash24. I was more
concerned not to break people's software than to keep the majority of
users safe. I have changed my opinion over the last six, seven years.

By the way I couldn't fix some problems in Python and our expat wrapper
either. The expat parser was missing features to properly implement
security measurements. I need to check if expat has been improved over
the years.

The topic is on the agenda for the core dev sprint.

I understood that Python 2.7.9 which required a valid TLS certificate
annoyed many customers. So I don't think that it would be a good idea
to enforce XML security in a minor Python release. But would it make
sense to make XML stricter in Python 3.8 and add an option to opt-out?
Or do we need a cycle of 1.5 year (Python 3.8) with a warning, and
change the default in the next cycle?

Thank you Victor.

XML support in Python is critical and desired for many sectors like banking or telecoms,
and code base based on XML is still on rise in such world.

That's why keeping such bugs open is important, as it is not impossible that someone (banks, telecoms, google camps, government grants)
would simply fund small project aiming at fixing those bugs in XML. We never know.

Would it be possible to send money to the PSF? I'm sure that the PSF
will be able to find you a developer able to quickly fix these XML
issues!

Feel free to send the money directly to me. After all I found the bugs,
documented them, and fixed them in defusedxml.

Not needed. Good patches are always welcome.  And if there is no current 
PR or other information indicating otherwise, a fix 'soon' is usually 
unlikely.

But what we mostly need is not more patches, but more reviews.  Anyone 
can act like a core dev up to the point of actually pushing the green 
merge button.

I'm used to signing CLA's that require nothing beyond a name and a check
box. When I went to sign the PSF Contributor Agreement so I can submit a PR
for CPython, I was surprised to see that it wants my address. Why does the
Python Software Foundation need this, especially when nobody else does?

So that our marketing partners can deliver exciting consumer shopping
opportunities directly to your front door ;-)

Seriously, "nobody else does" shows you haven't looked much.  For
example, the first two I just looked at also require a mailing
address:

Apache CLA
https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf

Android CLA
https://cla.developers.google.com/clas/new?domain=DOMAIN_GOOGLE&kind=KIND_INDIVIDUAL

So I'll guess that projects big enough to hire actual lawyers require
an address.  As to why they want an address, you'll have to ask a
lawyer!  There aren't any on this list.  So, if you really want to
pursue this, I suggest you direct the question instead to the Python
Software Foundation, which deals with the project's legalities:

    psf at python.org

Fair. I guess I should have said "nobody else that I've ever
contributed code upstream to does". (I suppose I have mostly
contributed to smaller, less formal projects in the past.)

While I am not a lawyer, or even play on on TV, I can imagine that for
such an agreement to really be enforced, they need to know who actually
is agreeing to it. Just a name isn't a unique a unique identifier, so
more information is needed.

I don't think I've ever received anything from the PSF by postal mail,
so if you don't want to give out your postal address, or simply don't
have one, then you can probably submit a fake one.

(I've never given that advice of course, you've invented it all by
yourself ;-))

I presume others are correct that an address helps as an identifier. 
Python is important enough to be a possible target of copyright 
lawsuits.  The purpose of collecting CLA's for all non-trivial 
contributions is to try to avoid lawsuits and make them easier to defend 
against should one happen anyway.  Part of the CLA is informing 
contributors that we only want code that can be legally contributed, and 
contributors agreeing that they will offer such.

DON'T DO THIS, anyone.  If you were to be a defendant or witness in a 
lawsuit, expect to be asked "Did you reside at this address when you 
signed the CLA?"  Lying under oath and admitting that you lied when 
signing are both unpleasant options.

It probably does, though it's hardly perfect.  Mostly it can serve as a
contact point, but these days an e-mail address might be more durable
than a postal address (and it's probably a much better identifier too).

You don't need someone's postal address to inform them, if you're not
sending them any paper material (which the PSF doesn't, AFAIR).  Asking
a contributor their postal address does not make them better informed.

I'm not sure why anyone would ask that question.  Residing somewhere
doesn't have much to do with copyright issues (except when determining
which national law should apply, and perhaps even not).  And a postal
address doesn't have to be where you reside, either : people can very
well have their postal address at a friend's or relative's while not
living there, and they can very well give different postal addresses
for different purposes (just like you can give a different e-mail
address to your professional and personal contacts).

Besides, even in a dysfunctional legal system, I'd be surprised if a
Python copyright lawsuit would involve asking all past Python
contributors (the thousands of them, assuming they can all be
successfully contacted and brought to the court) whether they did
really live at the postal address they once declared on their CLA.

But, yes, perhaps better to leave the entry blank or write "irrelevant",
if the PSF accepts that :-)

Regards

Antoine.

The PSF has received a few inquiries asking the question ? ?How do I cite
Python??So, I am reaching out to you all to figure this out.

(For those that don?t know my background, I have been in academia for a bit
as a Ph.D student and have worked at the Library of Congress writing code
to process Marc records <https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/>, among
other things.)

IMHO the citation for Python should be decided upon by the Python
developers and should live somewhere on the site.

Two questions to be answered?

   1. What format should it take?
   2. Where does it live on the site?

To help frame the first one, I quickly wrote this up ?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R0mo8EYVIPNkmNBImpcZTbk0e78T2oU71ioX5NvVTvY/edit#

tldr; Summary of possibilities?

   1. Article for one citation (1 DOI, generated by the publication)
   2. No article (many DOIs ? one for each major version through Zenodo

Hi Jackie!

FWIW, this has come up a few times in the past on python-ideas and/or
python-dev.  Sorry I don't have more info.  Alas, if I were at my computer
I could offer specifics. :)

A Name + Address is a practically perfect identifier, as most people
have a specific legal address of residence and at that address it is
very unlikely two people have identical legal names. It is this legal
address and legal name that people should be using for these sorts of
legal documents. Government tend to have a vested interest in keeping
track of legal addresses as this tends to have implications in things
like taxes, so piggy backing on this identification can help with
identification for other purposes.

There also tends to be official government documents that can track back
your 'official' address over time, so confirming that you are the Joe
Smith from 15 Main ST, Anytown USA, is possible. Try to think how you
could legally prove you were or were not the owner of
joe.smith at example.com 10 years ago, where example.com is some major free
email providers.

There are by now formats for citing web documents.  I presume style 
guides now include such.  Try a current version of the Chicago Manual of 
Style.  (not sure of exact title).  I will ask a university professor 
who should know more than I.

On https://bugs.python.org/issue26597, I suggested the Copyright page. 
I now think a link to 'Citing these Documents' on https://docs.python.org/3/
would be even better.

Yes... there are many prescribed formats already. That is the easy part.

I don't know what you mean by this.

Different publications use different citation formats.  We cannot 
dictate which format an author or publication uses.  We could, and I 
think should, suggest the content of the different fields that go into 
the various formats.  And we could give examples of citing, say, the 
Reference Manual, in the most common formats.

The PSF is the publisher.  It seems that you might be more competent to 
make some of the decisions than are we developers, who have mostly left 
academia some time ago.

Citation Style Language -- supported by a number of citation tools such as
Zotero and Mendeley -- is used to generate citations in very many citation
styles such as Chicago, MLA,
https://citationstyles.org
https://citationstyles.org/authors/
https://www.zotero.org/styles (9141 styles, really)
https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles

BibTeX can be generated with CSL.

SciPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and pandas all list bibtex citations in
their docs.

https://www.scipy.org/citing.html
- [ ] Add the Python citation to this list

http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#citing-scikit-learn
https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/#citation
https://pandas.pydata.org/talks.html

BibTeX is rather unspecified; in terms of which fields/attributes to define.

Search engines index schema.org metadata; which can be represented as RDF
in HTML (RDFa), microdata, JSON-LD:

https://schema.org/CreativeWork
  https://schema.org/Code
  https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication
  https://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle

Ideally, a tool such as Zotero or Mendeley can auto-detect and parse the
citation for reformatting (with CSL) into whichever citation style is used
for a bibliography / works cited / tools section.

Are there separate citations for Python and CPython?

https://westurner.github.io/tools/#cpython

https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html

> This extension allows BibTeX citations to be inserted into documentation
generated by Sphinx, via a bibliography directive, and a cite role, which
work similarly to LaTeX?s thebibliography environment and \cite command.

A heading in the docs would be great.
People may also be likely to read the README.

If there are potentially multiple citations, sphinxcontrib-bibtex may be
worth adding to the CPython docs.

Wouldn't it make sense to ask the developers of the other Python 
implementations too?

Just my 0.02?,

If anyone wants to add support for additional zipfile encryption/decryption
methods, there are a few options:

(a) Fork the stdlib zipfile module and create one that supports the
additional features, posting it on PyPI.  That way it could have
dependencies on other third party libraries such as
https://cryptography.io/en/latest/.

(b) Figure out the set of hooks necessary for the zipfile module to support
pluggable encryption as an API so that external libraries could provide
encryption support to it.

(c) Write a library that wraps an existing third party zip file creation
tool or library instead of reusing the stdlib zipfile code.

Option (a) is probably easiest to start with... but creates a maintenance
burden of keeping that module up to date.

Option (b) will be more challenging, the zipfile API modifications and
their tests would need merging and would only show up in a future CPython
release (3.8 today).

Option (c) is entirely different, but would get you out of the business of
dealing with the zipfile spec itself.

Unstated option (n): write something entirely new not based on existing
code or tools.  An entirely different form of challenge.

In general the existing stdlib zipfile module code is not loved by any of
us who have had to work on it in the past decade, it is a hairy mess (but
does work, so it's got that going for it).  Granted, the zip format as a
specification vs the many implementations out there to be compatible with
is also what I'd call an underspecified mess...

What we can suggest, though, is what the information should be and that's
what Jackie is initially asking about, i.e. do we want a single reference
for the language that is version-agnostic or one for each Python release?

My vote is a single reference and leave it up to the person referencing to
clarify the version they are using. Seems the simplest to maintain
long-term.

I"d like ot know what thee citations are expected to be used for?

i.e. -- usually, academic papers have a collection of citiations to
acknowledge where you got an idea, or fact, or .... It serves both to
jusstify something and make it clear that it is not your own idea (i.e. not
pagerism).

in the enclosed doc, it says:

"""
*If someone publishes research, they will cite the exact major version that
was used, so if someone was trying to recreate the research they would be
able to do it.*
*"""*
That is about reproducible results, which is really a different thing than
the usual citations. In that case, you would want some way to identify the
actual source code (cPython version 3.6.4, and probably a url to the source
-- but how long might that last???) And you would need to post your own
source anyway.

Again, regular citation is about acknowledging the source of an idea or
fact, or something of that nature. I can imagine a paper about computer
language design or some such might need to reference Python -- in which
case it should reference the Language Reference, I suppose. Maybe we should
have a DOI for each version of the standard docs.

But "I wrote some code in Python to produce these statistics" -- does that
need a citation? If so, maybe that would take a different form.

Anyway, hard to make this decision without some idea how the citation is
intended to be used.

Message-ID: <3ABAB3B5-6346-49F2-98F7-185303166016@python.org>

I have updated the schedules for the next maintenance releases of Python 3.7.x and 3.6.x.  My original plan had been to get 3.7.1, the first 3.7 maintenance release, out by the end of July.  It was solely my fault that that did not happen so I hope you'll accept my apologies; I will try to not let it happen again.  I have now scheduled a 3.7.1 release candidate and rescheduled the 3.6.7 release candidate for 2018-09-18, about a week from today, and 3.7.1 final and 3.6.7 final for 2018-09-28.  That allows us to take advantage of fixes generated at the Core Developers sprint taking place this week.

Please review any open issues you are working on or are interested in and try to get them merged in to the 3.7 and/or 3.6 branches soon - by the beginning of next week at the latest.  As usual, if there are any issues you believe need to be addressed prior to these releases, please ensure there are open issues for them in the bug tracker (bugs.python.org) and that their priorities are set accordingly (e.g. "release blocker").

Thanks for your support!

I don't think it is. I think you are seeing a distinction that is not 
there. If citations were just about acknowledgement, we could say "I got 
this idea from Bob" and be done with it. Citations are about identifying 
the *exact* source so that anyone can reproduce the given ideas by 
checking not just "Bob" but the specific page number of a specific 
edition of a specific work.

So the requirement for precision is no different between papers and 
software, and the academic standards for citing software already take 
that into account. There are challenges with software, to be sure -- 
code is much more ephemeral, there may be literally hundreds of 
authors, etc. But in principle, the kinds of information needed to 
cite a software package is known. The major citation styles already 
include this. When you are using a specific style, this page:

https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/about/

suggests a few formats, depending on how you got access to the software.

The bottom line is, we don't have to guess what information to provide. 
People like Jacqueline can tell us what they need, and we'll just fill 
in the values.

The people citing Python know what information they need, we just have 
to help them get it. I think that the best way to do that is to provide 
the correct information in a single place, in a single, standard format, 
and let them choose the appropriate citation style for their 
publication.

Jackie, do I have that right?

I also see reproducibility and citation graphs as distinct concepts.

If it's reproducibility you're after, bibliographic citations are very
unlikely to enable someone else to assemble an identical build environment
from which the same conclusion should be repeatably derivable.

A ScholarlyArticle can be reproducible with no citations whatsoever.
A ScholarlyArticle may very likely have many citations and still be
woefully unreproducible.

This citation doesn't contain a URL, but still isn't quite useless (while
the paper is excellent); because there's at least a DOI string:

Sandve GK, Nekrutenko A, Taylor J, Hovig E (2013) Ten Simple Rules for
Reproducible Computational Research. PLoS Comput Biol 9(10): e1003285.
doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285

> Rule 3: Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used

mybinder.org builds Jupyter containers from git repositories that contain
config files with repo2docker.

https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#configuration-files
"""
Dockerfile
environment.yml
requirements.txt
REQUIRE
install.R
apt.txt
setup.py
postBuild
runtime.txt
"""

Specifying the exact version of Python (and what package it was installed
from and/or what URL the source was obtained and built from) is no
substitute for hashes of the 'pinned' versions of said artifacts.

# includes the python version
$ conda env export -f environment.yml

# these do not include the python version
$ pip freeze -r requirements.txt --all
$ pipenv lock # > Pipfile.lock
$ pipenv sync # < Pipfile.lock

Uploading a built container or VM image to e.g. Docker Hub / GitLab
Container Registry / Vagrant Cloud is another way to ensure that research
findings are reproducible.
- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
- Vagrantfile

> Rule 4: Version Control All Custom Scripts

https://mozillascience.github.io/code-research-object/ (FigShare + GitHub
=> DOI citation URI)

https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ (Zenodo + GitHub => DOI
citation URI)

...

Is it necessary to cite Python (or all packages) if you're not building a
derivative of Python or said packages?

It's definitely a good idea to "Archive the Exact Versions of All External
Programs Used"; but IDK that those are best represented with bibliographic
citations. Really, a link to the Homepage, Source, Docs, and Wikipedia page
are probably more helpful to a reviewer that's not familiar with and wants
to help support by linking dereferenceable URLs and https://5stardata.info.

While out of scope and OT, it's worth mentioning that search engines index
https://schema.org/Dataset metadata; which is helpful for data reuse and
autodiscovering requisite premises for the argument presented in a
https://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle .

A citation for each MAJ.MIN.PATCH revision of CPython (and/or other
excellent packages) might be a bit much.

no need for us to agree on that, but there are still multiple reasons /
ways you might want to cite Python, and what you would want to cite would
be different.

Lets say one were to write an article about how different computer
languages express functional programming concepts -- you may want to cite
Python, but you are not trying to identify a specific version for
reproducible results.

And see Wes Turner's note -- it is highly unlikely that a single citation
to a standard document or something will be enough for reproducibility
anyway.

I think this thread is about *academic* citations. I know the feature 
request I linked to earlier is, because I opened it and that's what I 
intended :-)

Informal citations can include as much or as little information as you 
care to give. It could be as little as "use Python" or it could be a 
link to a specific branch or tag in a repo, complete with detailed 
instructions on building the environment up to and including the OS and 
processor type. But those sorts of detailed build instructions aren't 
really a *citation*, they are more along the lines of the 
experimental design ("First, compile Linux using gcc ...").

There's a metric ton of information on the web about citing software, 
there are existing standards, and I really think you are 
over-complicating this. See, for example:

https://www.software.ac.uk/how-cite-software

http://www.citethisforme.com/cite/software

https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/about/#q12

Its not our job to tell academics how to cite, they already have a 
number of standardised templates that they use, but it is our job to 
tell them what information to fill into the template.

I don't think we need to lose any sleep over how random bloggers and 
Redditors informally cite Python. I think the focus here is on academic 
citations, which have rather precise and standard requirements. No need 
to expand the scope of this problem to arbitrary mentions of Python.

Besides, if we have a sys.cite() function that provides the relevant 
information, bloggers etc will soon learn to pick and choose the bits 
they care about from it, even if they don't give a proper academic style 
citation.

Of course it is possible that I've completely misunderstood Jackie's 
request. If so, hopefully she will speak up soon.

The academic community seems to think that it is. We don't have to tell 
them that they're wrong.

The fact that those posts exist demonstrates that this is anything but a
solved problem.

yes, of course -- I don't know why this thread got sidetracked into
citation formats, that has nothing to do with it. Or as the op said, that's
"the easy part"

Why in the world would you think "article" meant random bloggers? In
BiBTex, for instance, a paper in a peer reviewed journal is called an
"article", as apposed to a book, or chapter, or inproceedings, or
techreport, or.... As this whole thread is about academic citations, I
assumed that...

not for software, yet.

I was not expanding it -- I was hoping to contract it -- or at least better
define it.

I think we're all on the same page about that, actually.

My point, to be more pedantic about it, is that an academic paper might be
*about* Python in some way, or it might describe work that *used* Python as
a tool to accomplish some other understanding. These *may* require a
different citation.

And a citation that satisfies academic criteria for using Python may not be
enough to assure reproducible results.

The Academic community has a really bad track record with reproducible
results for computationally based research -- it is not a solved problem.

And it's not a "they" -- many of us on this list are part of the academic
community.

Of these, I think the Python Reference Manual is the only one that comes
close as a general citation for the langue itself. And it would be a
particular version, presumably. But those old versions are published as
tech reports by a know institution -- easier to cite than teh PSF.

I've seen folks cite various academic articles to satisfy a citation for a
language or library, but often that is simply because that is the one thing
they could find that is citable in the standard way.

sure -- though I don't think "article" is the correct catagory -- probbaly
technical report.

Looking at the current "official" docs, the copyright is held by the PSF,
but I see no author mentioned (I recall it said Fred Drake many years
back...) I take that back -- the PDF version has an author.

So I'm thinking maybe:

@techreport{techreport,
  author       = {Guido van Rossum and the Python development team},
  title        = {Python Language Reference, release 3.7.0},
  institution  = {Python Software Foundation},
  year         = 2018,
  address      = {9450 SW Gemini Dr. ECM# 90772, Beaverton, OR 97008 USA},
  number       = 3.7,
  url .        = {https://docs.python.org/release/3.7.0/},
}

I used "Guido van Rossum and the Python development team" as the Author, as
that's what it says on the PDF version. Not sure how bibliography software
will deal with that...

And what do we do with version? part of the title, or (ab)use number (Or
volume, or ....)

And it would be better to cite the entire standard docs, rather than just
the language reference, but I"m not sure what to call it -- there is no
single document with a title.

And a DOI for each release would be nice.

Subject: [Python-Dev] bpo-34595: How to format a type name?
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGFWFdTceJPTY8V_M6QBWRs9860GKLZRu0+jTMg9F4Acuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Last week, I opened an issue to propose to add a new %T formatter to
PyUnicode_FromFormatV() and so indirectly to PyUnicode_FromFormat()
and PyErr_Format():

   https://bugs.python.org/issue34595

I merged my change, but then Serhiy Storchaka asked if we can add
something to get the "fully qualified name" (FQN) of a type, ex
"datetime.timedelta" (FQN) vs "timedelta" (what I call "short" name).
I proposed a second pull request to add %t (short) in addition to %T
(FQN).

But then Petr Viktorin asked me to open a thread on python-dev to get
a wider discussion. So here I am.


The rationale for this change is to fix multiple issues:

* C extensions use Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name which returns a fully
qualified name for C types, but the name (without the module) for
Python name. Python modules use type(obj).__name__ which always return
the short name.

* currently, many C extensions truncate the type name: use "%.80s"
instead of "%s" to format a type name

* "%s" with Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name is used more than 200 times in the C
code, and I dislike this complex pattern. IMHO "%t" with obj would be
simpler to read, write and maintain.

* I want C extensions and Python modules to have the same behavior:
respect the PEP 399. Petr considers that error messages are not part
of the PEP 399, but the issue is wider than only error messages.


The main issue is that at the C level, Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name is
"usually" the fully qualified name for types defined in C, but it's
only the "short" name for types defined in Python.

For example, if you get the C accelerator "_datetime",
PyTYPE(obj)->tp_name of a datetime.timedelta object gives you
"datetime.timedelta", but if you don't have the accelerator, tp_name
is just "timedelta".

Another example, this script displays "mytimedelta(0)" if you have the
C accelerator, but "__main__.mytimedelta(0)" if you use the Python
implementation:
---
import sys
#sys.modules['_datetime'] = None
import datetime

class mytimedelta(datetime.timedelta):
    pass

print(repr(mytimedelta()))
---

So I would like to fix this kind of issue.


Type names are mainly used for two purposes:

* format an error message
* obj.__repr__()

It's unclear to me if we should use the "short" or the "fully
qualified" name. It should maybe be decided on a case by case basis.

There is also a 3rd usage: to implement __reduce__, here backward
compatibility matters.


Note: The discussion evolved since my first implementation of %T which
just used the not well defined Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name.

--

Petr asked me why not exposing functions to get these names. For
example, with my second PR (not merged), there are 3 (private)
functions:

/* type.__name__ */
const char* _PyType_Name(PyTypeObject *type);
/* type.__qualname__ */
PyObject* _PyType_QualName(PyTypeObject *type);
* type.__module__ "." type.__qualname__ (but type.__qualname__ for
builtin types) */
PyObject * _PyType_FullName(PyTypeObject *type);

My concern here is that each caller has to handler error:

  PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError, "must be str, not %.100s",
Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name);

would become:

  PyObject *type_name = _PyType_FullName(Py_TYPE(obj));
  if (name == NULL) { /* do something with this error ... */
  PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError, "must be str, not %U", type_name);
  Py_DECREF(name);

When I report an error, I dislike having to handle *new* errors... I
prefer that the error handling is done inside PyErr_Format() for me,
to reduce the risk of additional bugs.

--

Serhiy also asked if we could expose the same feature at the *Python*
level: provide something to get the fully qualified name of a type.
It's not just f"{type(obj).__module}.{type(obj).__name__}", but you
have to skip the module for builtin types like "str" (not return
"builtins.str").

Maybe we can have "name: {0:t}, FQN: {0:T}".format(type(obj)). "t" for
name and "T" for fully qualfied name. We would only have to modify
type.__format__().

I'm not sure if we need to add new formatters to str % args.

Example of Python code:

   raise TypeError("must be str, not %s" % type(fmt).__name__)

I'm not sure about Python changes. My first concern was just to avoid
Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name at the C level. But again, we should keep C and
Python consistent. If the behavior of C extensions change, Python
modules should be adapted as well, to get the same behavior.


Note: I reverted my change which added the %T formatter from
PyUnicode_FromFormatV() to clarify the status of this issue.

That might be a genuine problem, but I wonder if "%T" is fixing the 
symptom rather than the cause here.
Or is this only an issue for PyUnicode_FromFormat()?

That's an orthogonal issue -- you can change "%.80s" to "%s", and 
presumably you could use "%.80t" as well.

I consider `Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name` much more understandable than "%t".
It's longer to spell out, but it's quite self-documenting.

The other major use is for __repr__, which AFAIK we also don't guarantee 
to be stable, so I don't think PEP 399 applies to it.
Having the same behavior between C and Python versions of a module is 
nice, but PEP 399 doesn't prescribe it. There are other differences as 
well -- for example, `_datetime.datetime` is immutable, and that's OK.

If error messages and __repr__s should be consistent between Python and 
the C accelerator, are you planning to write tests for all the affected 
modules when switching them to %T/%t?

I'm not sure about having 2 different, though similar, format codes for 
2 similar, though slightly different, cases. (And, for all we know, we 
might want to use "%t" at some later date for something else.)

Perhaps we could have a single format code plus an optional '#' for the 
"alternate form":

%T for short form
%#T for fully qualified name

FWIW, I personally think this went to python-dev prematurely. This is a
shallow problem and IMO doesn't need all that much handwringing. Yes, there
are a few different alternatives. So list them all concisely in the tracker
and think about it for a few minutes and then pick one. No matter what's
picked it'll be better than the status quo -- which is that printing a
class name produces either a full or a short name depending on whether it's
defined in C or Python, and there's no simple pattern (in C) to print
either the full or the short name.

+1 for adding format specs for the types, and for giving a consistent 
way to specify which you want.  %t (short) and %T (long) do seem like 
the logical choices, and I think in context it'll be pretty evident what 
they mean.

OTOH, if %T and variants meant "type" but %t mean something entirely 
different, that *would* probably be confusing.

After a discussion with Victor. I'll summarize where we are now.

There are actually two inconsistencies to fix:
- Python modules use `type(obj).__name__` and C extensions use 
`Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name`, which inconsistent.
- Usage __name__ or __qualname__, and prepending __module__ or not, is 
inconsistent across types/modules.

It turns out that today, when you want to print out a type name, you 
nearly always want the fully qualified name (including the module unless 
it's "builtins"). So we can just have "%T" and not "%t". (Or we can add 
"%t" if a use case arises).

It should be possible to do this also in Python, preferably using a name 
similar to "%T".

Most of the usage is in error messages and __repr__, where we don't need 
to worry about compatibility too much.

It should be possible to get the name if you have the type object, but 
not an instance of it. So, the proposed `PyUnicode_FromFormat("%T", 
obj)` is incomplete -- if we go that way, we'll also need a function 
like PyType_GetFullName. Making "%T" work on the type, e.g. 
`PyUnicode_FromFormat("%T", Py_TYPE(obj))`, would be more general.

---

So, I propose adding a "%T" formatter to PyUnicode_FromFormat, to be 
used like this:
     PyUnicode_FromFormat("%T", Py_TYPE(obj))
and a "T" format code for type.__format__, to be used like this:
     f"{type(obj):T}"

I think folks used to %-formatting are already used to un-related but 
similar codes (and related but dissimilar):

- %M for minute
- %m for month  (or maybe I have that backwards)
- %H for 24-hour clock
- %I for 12-hour clock
- %w for weekday as decimal number
- %W for week number of the year

I always have to look it up.  :(

Well, for the time of day (24-hour) it's %H:%M:%S, all uppercase.

Thank you for opening this discussion Victor. I wanted to do it myself, 
but you have wrote much better description of the problem. See also 
related issues:

https://bugs.python.org/issue21861
https://bugs.python.org/issue22032 (solved)
https://bugs.python.org/issue22033 (solved)
https://bugs.python.org/issue27541 (solved)
https://bugs.python.org/issue28062

There were also attempts to change repr/str of types so that they return 
just a FQN. It would help to solve the issue from Python side. This idea 
was initially suggested by Guido, but later he changed his mind.

> The rationale for this change is to fix multiple issues:

Sometimes Python modules use FQN, but this is not common, and the code 
is cumbersome. It is more common to use obj.__class__ instead of 
type(obj), the difference is intentionally ignored.

> * currently, many C extensions truncate the type name: use "%.80s"
> instead of "%s" to format a type name

AFAIK the rationale of this in PyUnicode_FromFormat() is that if you 
have corrupted type object, tp_name can point on arbitrary place in 
memory, and an attempt to interpret it as null terminated string can 
output a large amount of trash. It is better to get a truncated type 
name in error message (names of real types usually are below that limit) 
than get tons of trash or an error in attempt to format it.

> type.__format__().

This will make the feature inconsistent in Python and C. In Python, the 
argument is a type, in C it is an instance of the type. We need a way to 
format a FQN in C for types themselves. It is less common case, but 
using _PyType_FullName() for it is very non-convenient as you have shown 
above.

When you started talking about *articles* rather than *papers*. Articles 
are far more general and include anything up to and including posts on 
Reddit.

Anyway, I think until Jackie returns to clarify what precisely she hopes 
to gain, I don't think further discussion on-list is warranted.

This commit message looks awful (and it is duplicated in maintained 
branches). Please stop automerging to master by bots. The reason of 
automating merging before is that the core dev that performs merging is 
responsible for editing the commit message. There were mistakes from 
time to time, but usually regular commiters did care of this.

I often use "git log", and such commit messages spoil the history.

It is still up to the core dev to set the message properly, but the HTML
comments are invisible on GitHub until you edit the message. That bug is
now fixed, though; HTML comments are stripped from the message before
creating the commit.

Thanks Zach for fixing it quickly.

Even if that bug has been fixed, per my instructions to python-committers,
core devs should still edit the PR title and PR description *before* adding
the '? automerge' label.

The YouTube video (link in python-committers  email) shows to edit those.

The PR title and body will be used as the squashed commit message.

And remember, you can still merge the PR manually. Just don't apply the  '?
automerge' label.

Since the commit is described as a follow-up of
90fc8980bbcc5c7dcced3627fe172b0bfd193a3b, maybe it could also include
"bpo-31902: " prefix in it's title. Just to ease following where the
change comes from.

IMHO the main complain of Serhiy was the giant <!-- ... --> comment
;-) I agree that this one has to go, and hopefully it's already fixed.
We are now good!

Oh yes, one issue of missing bpo-xxx is that bots don't report merged
commits into the bpo. I like using the bpo issue to track backports:

https://bugs.python.org/issue31902

It was just a general remark, it's fine for these commits. Someone can
add them manually to the bpo if you want.

Hi!
I finally had time to read the PEPs carefully.

Overall, great work! PEP 580 does look complicated, but it's well 
thought out and addresses real problems.

I think the main advantage over the competing PEP 576 is that it's a 
better foundation for solving Cython (and other C-API users) and my PEP 
573 (module state access from methods).


With that, I do have some comments.

The reference to PEP 573 is premature. If PEP 580 is implemented then 
PEP 573 will build on top, and I don't plan to update PEP 573 before 
that. So, I think 580 should be independent. If you agree I can 
summarize rationale for "parent", as much as it concerns 580.

# Using tp_print

The tp_print gimmick is my biggest worry.
AFAIK there's no guarantee that a function pointer and Py_ssize_t are 
the same size. That makes the backwards-compatibility typedef in the 
implementation is quite worrying:
     typedef Py_ssize_t printfunc
I can see the benefit for backporting to earlier Python versions, and 
maybe that outweighs worries about exotic architectures, but the PEP 
should at least have more words on why this is not a problem.


# The C Call protocol

I really like the fact that, in the reference implementation, the flags 
are arranged in a way that allows a switch statement to select what to 
call. That should be noted, if only to explain why there's no guarantee 
of compatibility between Python versions.


# Descriptor behavior

I'd say "SHOULD" rather than "MUST" here. The section describes how to 
implement expected/reasonable behavior, but I see no need to limit that.

"if func supports the C call protocol, then func.__set__ must not be 
implemented." -- also, __delete__ should not be implemented, right?.


# Generic API functions

I'm a bit worried about PyCCall_FASTCALL's "kwds" argument accepting a 
dict, which is mutable. I wouldn't mind dropping that capability, but if 
it stays, we need to require that the callable promises to not modify it.

PyCCall_FASTCALL is not a macro, shouldn't it be named PyCCall_FastCall?


# C API functions

The function PyCFunction_GetFlags is, for better or worse, part of the 
stable ABI. We shouldn't just give up on it. I'm fine with documenting 
that it shouldn't be used, but for functions defined using 
PyCFunction_New etc. it should continue behaving as before.
One solution could be to preserve the "definition time" METH_* flags in 
the 0xFFF bits of cc_flags and use the other bits for CCALL_*.


# Stable ABI

The section should repeat that PyCFunction_ClsNew is added to the stable 
ABI (but nothing else).

Subject: [Python-Dev] bpo-34595: How to format a type name?

Hi,

For the type name, sometimes, we only get a type (not an instance),
and we want to format its FQN. IMHO we need to provide ways to format
the FQN of a type for *types* and for *instances*. Here is my
proposal:

* Add !t conversion to format string
* Add ":T" format to type.__format__()
* Add "%t" and "%T" formatters to PyUnicode_FromUnicodeV()
* Add a read-only type.__fqn__ property


# Python: "!t" for instance
raise TypeError(f"must be str, not {obj!t}")

/* C: "%t" for instance */
PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError, "must be str, not %t", obj);


/* C: "%T" for type */
PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError, "must be str, not %T", mytype);

# Python: ":T" for type
raise TypeError(f"must be str, not {mytype!T}")


Open question: Should we also add "%t" and "%T" formatters to the str
% args operator at the Python level?

I have a proof-of-concept implementation:

That depends on what you mean by "statistics" and whether (as one
should) one makes the code available.  If the code is published or
"available on request", definitely, Python should be cited.  If not,
and by "statistics" you mean the kind of things provided by Steven
d'Aprano's excellent statistics module (mean, median, standard
deviation, etc), maybe no citation is needed.  But anything more
esoteric than that (even linear regression), yeah, I would say you
should cite both Python and any reference you used to learn the
algorithm or formulas, in the context of mentioning that your
statistics are home-brew, not produced by one of the recognized
applications for doing so.

 > If so, maybe that would take a different form.

Yes, it would.  But not so different: eg, version is analogous to
edition when citing a book.

Same as any other citation, (1) to give credit to those responsible
for providing a resource (this is why publishers and their metadata of
city are still conventionally included), and (2) to show where that
resource can be obtained.  AFAICS, both motivations are universally
applicable in polite society.  NB: Replication is an important reason
for wanting to acquire the resource, but it's not the only one.

I think underlying your comment is the question of *what* resource is
being cited.  I can think of three offhand that might be characterized
as "Python".  First, the PSF, as a provider of funding.  There is a
conventional form for this: a footnote on the title or author's name
saying "The author acknowledges [a] <purpose of grant such as travel>
grant [grant identifier if available] from the Python Software
Foundation."  I usually orally mention them in presentations, too.
That one's easy; *everybody* should *always* do that.

The rest of these, sort of an ideal to strive for.  If you keep a
bibliographic database, and there are now quite a few efforts to crowd
source them, it's easier to go the whole 9 yards than to skimp.  But
except in cases where we don't need to even mention the code, probably
we should be citing, for reasons of courtesy to readers as well as
authors, editors, and publishers (as disgusting as many publishers are
as members of society, they do play a role in providing many resources
---we should find ways to compete them into good behavior, not
ostracize them).

The second is the Python *language and standard library*.  Then the
Language Reference and/or the Library Reference should be cited
briefly when Python is first mentioned, and in the text introducing a
program or program fragment, with a full citation in the bibliography.
I tentatively suggest that the metadata for the Language Reference
would be

    Author: principal author(s) (Guido?) et al. OR python.org OR
        Python Contributors
    Title: The Python Language Reference
    Version: to match Python version used (if relevant, different
        versions each get full citations), probably should not be
        "current"
    Publisher: Python Software Foundation
    Date: of the relevant version
    Location: City of legal address of PSF
    URL: to version used (probably should not be the default)
    Date accessed: if "current" was used

The Library reference would be the same except for Title.

The third is a *particular implementation*.  In that case the metadata
would be

    Author: principal author(s) (Guido) et al. OR python.org OR
        Python Contributors
    Title: The cPython Python distribution
    Python Version: as appropriate (if relevant, different versions each
        get full citations), never "current"
    Distributor Version: if different from Python version (eg, additional
        Debian cruft)
    Publisher: Distributor (eg, PSF, Debian Project, Anaconda Inc.)
    Date: of the relevant version
    Location: City of legal address of distributor

If downloaded:

    URL: to version used (including git commit SHA1 if available)
    Date accessed: download from distributor, not installation date

If received on physical medium: use the "usual" form of citation for a
collection of individual works (even if Python was the only thing on
it).  Probably the only additional information needed would be the
distributor as editor of the collection and the name of the
collection.

In most cases I can think of, if the implementation is cited, the
Language and Library References should be cited, too.

Finally, if Python or components were modified for the project, the
modified version should be preserved in a repository and a VCS
identifier provided.  This does not imply the repository need be
publicly accessible, of course, although it might be for other reasons
(eg, in a GSoC project,wherever or if hosted for free on GitHub).

I doubt that "URNs" like DOI and ISBN are applicable, but if available
they should be included in all cases as well.

Do you guys think we should all cite Grub and BusyBox and bash and libc and
setuptools and pip and openssl and GNU/Linux and LXC and Docker; or else
it's plagiarism for us all?

There was a thread about adding __cite__ to things and a tool to collect
those citations awhile back.

"[Python-ideas] Add a __cite__ method for scientific packages"
http://markmail.org/thread/rekmbmh64qxwcind

Which CPython source file should contain this __cite__ value?

... On a related note, you should ask the list admin to append a URL to
each mailing list message whenever this list is upgraded to mm3; so that
you can all be appropriately cited.

As far as I can remember, the distinction between lowercase and 
uppercase format letter for PyUnicode_FromUnicodeV() and friends was: 
lowercase letters are for formatting C types (like `char *` etc.) and 
uppercase formatting letters are for Python types (i.e. the C type is 
`PyObject *`). IMHO we should keep that distinction.

I like that.

We could solve the problem with instances and classes by adding two new 
! operators to str.format/f-strings and making them chainable. The !t 
operator would get the class of the argument and the !c operator would 
require a class argument and would convert it to its name (which is 
obj.__module__ + "." + obj.__qualname__ (or only obj.__qualname__ for 
builtin types)). So:

    >>> import pathlib
    >>> p = pathlib.Path("spam.py")
    >>> print(f"{pathlib.Path}")
     <class 'pathlib.Path'>
    >>> print(f"{pathlib.Path!c}")
     pathlib.Path
    >>> print(f"{pathlib.Path!c!r}")
     'pathlib.Path'
    >>> print(f"{p!t}")
     <class 'pathlib.Path'>
    >>> print(f"{p!t!c}")
     pathlib.Path
    >>> print(f"{p!c}")
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     TypeError: object is not a class

This would also give us:

    >>> print(f"{p!s!r}")
     'spam.py'

Which is different from:

    >>> print(f"{p}")
     spam.py
    >>> print(f"{p!r}")
     PosixPath('spam.py')

It seems to me that PEP 580 helps with the use case of PEP 573. In fact, 
it implements part of what PEP 573 proposes. So I don't see the problem 
with the reference to PEP 573. Even if the implementation of PEP 573 
changes, the problem statement will remain and that's what I'm referring to.

Sure. I still think that we should refer to PEP 573, but maybe we can 
summarize it also in PEP 580.

I'm not actually claiming anywhere that it is the same size.

There *is* actually an important reason to limit it: it allows code to 
make assumptions on what __get__ does. This enables optimizations which 
wouldn't be possible otherwise. If you cannot be sure what __get__ does, 
then you cannot optimize

obj.method(x)

to

type(obj).method(obj, x)

Indeed. I write Python but I think C API, so for me these are both 
really tp_descr_set.

> PyCCall_FASTCALL is not a macro, shouldn't it be named PyCCall_FastCall?

What's the convention for that anyway? I assumed that capital letters 
meant a "really know what you are doing" function which could segfault 
if used badly.

For me, whether something is a function or macro is just an 
implementation detail (which can change between Python versions) which 
should not affect the naming.

I'm fine with that if you insist. However, it would be a silly solution 
to formally satisfy the "stable ABI" requirement without actually helping.


I agree with your other points that I didn't reply to and will make some 
edits to PEP 580.

I'm strongly opposed to this. This !t conversion would not be widely 
applicable enough to be generally useful, and would need to be exposed 
in the f-string and str.format() documentation, even though 99% of 
programmers would never need or see it. The purpose of the conversions 
is not to save you from making a function call when you know the type of 
the arguments. The purpose was specifically to convert arguments to 
strings so that your format specifier could always use the string 
formatting mini-language. It was more useful in str.format(), where the 
format string might be written separately (as user input or a 
translation, say) and not know the types of the arguments. You can (and 
I have!) argued that the conversions are completely unneeded in f-strings.

raise TypeError(f"must be str, not {obj!t}")

Should be written as:
raise TypeError(f"must be str, not {type(obj)}")


> * Add ":T" format to type.__format__()
As you know (I've read the patch) this is just "T". I mention it here 
for future readers. They should understand that the ":" is a 
str.format() and f-string construct, and is unknown to __format__().

That said, I think this is a good idea. type.__format__() could also 
understand "#"? to specify qualname.

> * Add "%t" and "%T" formatters to PyUnicode_FromUnicodeV()
I think "T" is a good idea, but I think you're adding in obj vs 
type(obj) just because of the borrowed reference issue in Py_TYPE(). 
That issue is so much larger than string formatting the type of an 
object that it shouldn't be addressed here.

> * Add a read-only type.__fqn__ property
I'm not sure of the purpose of this. When in your examples is it used?

No. Again, I think any formatting of type names should not be in a 
widely used interface, and should remain in our type-specific interface, 
__format__. %-formatting has no per-type extensibility, and I don't 
think we should start adding codes for every possible use case. Format 
codes for datetimes would be way more useful that %t, and I'd be opposed 
to adding them, too. (I realize my analogy is stretched, because every 
object has a type. But still.)

I want to make it clear that PEP 580 doesn't depend on 579. Reviewers 
don't need to agree with PEP 579 to accept 580.

Here's my proposed rewording: 
https://github.com/python/peps/pull/775/files?short_path=b34f00e#diff-b34f00eeb75773c32f9b22fd7fee9771

Indeed, I was thinking ahead here. Backporting this to earlier versions 
of CPython will not be completely trivial, but let's leave it to Cython.

I see now. Yes, that's reasonable.

Well, I don't think that's a useful distinction either. This is C; 
pretty much anything can segfault when used badly.

Macros tend to be "fast": Py_TYPE just gets a member of a struct; 
Py_INCREF just increments a number. METH_NOARGS is just a number. None 
of them are very dangerous.
IMO, PyTuple_GET_ITEM is not uppercase because it's dangerous, but 
because it just reaches into memory.

True. I'm not saying the convention is very strict or useful.

Yes, it's definitely very silly. But that's not a reason to break our 
promise to the users. After all it's called "stable ABI", not "useful 
ABI" :)

I discussed this with Eric in-person this morning at the core dev 
sprints.? Eric's understanding is that this is motivated by the fact 
that Py_TYPE() returns a borrowed reference, and by switching to this !t 
conversion we could avoid using Py_TYPE() when formatting error 
messages.? My quick thoughts on this:

  * If Py_TYPE() is a bad API, then it's a bad API and should be
    replaced.? We should have a new version of Py_TYPE() that returns a
    strong reference.
  * If we're talking about formatting error messages, we're formatting
    an exception, which means we're already no longer in
    performance-sensitive code.? So we should use the new API that
    returns a strong reference.? The negligible speed hit of taking the
    extra reference will be irrelevant.


Cheers,

(I'm thinking aloud.)

In the Python code base, I found 115 lines using type(obj).__name__
and 228 lines using obj.__class__.__name__.

$ scm.py grep 'type(.*).__name__'|wc -l
115
$ scm.py grep '.__class__.__name__'|wc -l
228

I don't know how to compare these numbers, so I tried to count the
number of f-strings:

$ git grep '[^"%-]\<f"'|wc -l
405
$ git grep "[^'%-]\<f'"|wc -l
864


I'm not sure if type(obj) or obj.__class__ should be used, but I can
say that they are different: obj.__class__ can be overriden:
---
class OtherType:
    pass

class MyType:
    __class__ = OtherType

x = MyType()
print(f"type(x): {type(x)})")
print(f"x.__class__: {x.__class__}")
---

Output:
---
type(x): <class '__main__.MyType'>)
x.__class__: <class 'int'>
---


Moreover, it's also possible to override the "type" symbol in the
global or local scope:
---
type = id
num = 42
print(f"type(num): {type(num)}")
# Output: "type(num): 139665950357856"
---

One advantage of having a builtin formatter would be to always use
internally the builtin type() function to get the type of an object,
or not use "type()" in the current scope. The second advantage is to
prevent the need of having to decide between type(obj) and
obj.__class__ :-)


> raise TypeError(f"must be str, not {obj!t}")
>
> Should be written as:
> raise TypeError(f"must be str, not {type(obj)}")

f"{type(obj)}" behaves as str(type(obj)), but in practice it uses
repr(type(obj)):

>>> f"{type(42)}"
"<class 'int'>"

My proposed f"{obj!t}" returns the fully qualified name of the object type:

>>> f"{42!t}"
"int"

Do you want to modify str(type) to return a value different than repr(type)?

Or maybe it's just a typo and you wanted to write f"{type(obj):T}"?

When I discussed with Petr Viktorin, we failed to find an usecase
where __qualname__ was needed. We agreed that we always want the fully
qualified name, not just the qualified name.

Right, that's a side effect of the discussion on the C API. It seems
like Py_TYPE() has to go in the new C API. Sorry, the rationale is not
written down yet, but Dino convinced me that Py_TYPE() has to go :-)

Ok, that's fine with me :-)

"!t" is not a big improvement over ":T" and "type(obj)".

I don't think either of those are problematic. If you override 
`__class__` or `type`, things will behave weirdly, and that's OK.

Yes, AFAIK that was a typo.

I'll be happy when we get rid of Py_TYPE and get to use moving garbage 
collectors... but now is not the time.
The API for "%T" should be "give me the type". The best way to do that 
might change in the future.


But at this point, we're bikeshedding. I think all the relevant voices 
have been heard.

f'{type(obj)}' becomes type(obj).__format__(''), so you can return 
something other than __str__ or __repr__ does. It's only by convention 
that an object's __format__ returns __str__: it need not do so.

Hi,

during the Python core developer sprint, Steve Dower forced ^H^H^H^H^H^H
convinced me into looking into the XML security bugs again. I come with
fixes for all issues. However all security fixes require a change of
behavior. I strongly believe that the change doesn't affect the majority
of users in a negative way.

For entity expansion attacks (billion laughs, quadratic blowup), the
issue cannot be fixed in a libexpat callback. I decided that it's better
to fix the issue in expat directly. libxml2 added limits for entity
expansion many years ago, too. I created a patch for libexpat to limit
nesting depths, entity length and ratio between XML data and expansion,
https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/pull/220 . The PR is a proof of
concept.

For the external entity and DTD bug in SAX and pulldom parser, I changed
the default setting in PR https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9217 .
When accepted, the parsers no longer load and embed files from local
directories or network locations.

Regards,
Christian

https://bugs.python.org/issue28974

Oh, I didn't know that a type is free to change this behavior: return
something different than str(obj) if the format spec is an empty
string.

So are you suggesting to change type(obj).__format__('') to return the
fully qualified name instead of repr(type)?

So "%s" % type(obj) would use repr(), but "{}".format(type(obj)) and
f"{type(obj)}" would return the fully qualified name?

True! That issue was specific to object.__format__, not any other 
classes implementation of __format__.

I'm not suggesting it, I'm saying it's possible. It indeed might be the 
most useful behavior.

"%s" % type(obj) would use str(), not repr.

You could either:
- keep with convention and have type(obj).__format__('') return type(obj).__str__(), while type(obj).__format__('#') (or what other char you want to use) return the qualname;
or
- just have type(obj).__format__('') return the qualname, if that's the more useful behavior.

My understanding is that using Py_TYPE() inside the CPython
internals is okay (i.e. using a borrowed reference).  However,
extension modules would preferrably not use APIs that give back
borrowed references.  A clean API redesign would remove all of
those.

So, what are extension modules supposed to do?  We want to give them
an easy to use API.  If we give them %t that takes an object and
internally does the Py_TYPE() call, they have a simple way to do the
right thing.

E.g.

             PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                 "\"%s\" must be string, not %.200s", name,
                 src->ob_type->tp_name);

becomes

             PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                 "\"%s\" must be string, not %t", name, src);

This kind of code occurs often in extension modules.  If you make
them get a strong reference to the type, they have to remember to
decref it.  It's not a huge deal but is a bit harder to use.  I like
the proposal to provide both %t and %T.  Our format code is a bit
more complicated but many extension modules get a bit simpler.
That's a win, IMHO.

For the Python side, I don't think you need the % format codes.  You
need a idiomatic way of getting the type name.  repr() and str() of
the type object is not it.  I don't think changing them at this
point is a good idea.  So, having a new property would seem the
obvious solution.  E.g.

     f'"{name}" must be string, not {src.__class__.__qualname__}'

That __qualname__ property will be useful for other things, not just
building type error messages.

Hello Eddie,

Thank you for spending time to look into this.  Without studying the
details of your patch, your approach sounds correct to me.  I think
we should be allocating types from the heap and use PyType_FromSpec.
Having static type definitions living in the data segment cause too
many issues.

We have to assess how 3rd party extension modules would be affected
by this change.  Unless it is too hard to do, they should still
compile (perhaps with warnings) after your fix.  Do you know if
that's the case?  Looking at your changes to structseq.c, I can't
tell easily.

In any case, this should go into Victor's pythoncapi fork.  That
fork includes all the C-API cleanup we are hoping to make to CPython
(assuming we can figure out the backwards and forwards compatibility
issues). 

Here is the project site:

    https://pythoncapi.readthedocs.io

Regards,

  Neil

Nope, Victor's fork doesn't include all C-API cleanup. There's an older 
long-term effort (PEP-384, PEP-489, the current contenders 576/579/580, 
and PEP-573 for the future). Converting things to use PyType_FromSpec 
falls in there. As long as the old API still works, these changes should 
go in (but they might need a PEP).

From larry at hastings.org  Fri Sep 14 17:27:37 2018
From: larry at hastings.org (Larry Hastings)
Date: Fri, 14 Sep 2018 14:27:37 -0700
Subject: [Python-Dev] Store startup modules as C structures for 20%+ startup
 speed improvement?
Message-ID: <dfc2b162-1fca-6ec2-cfa7-d6cf467e8c14@hastings.org>


What follows is the text of issue 34690:

    https://bugs.python.org/issue34690

The PR is here:

    https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9320


I don't know if we should be discussing this here on python-dev, or on 
bpo, or on Zulip, or on the soon-to-be-created Discourse. But maybe we 
can talk about it somewhere!


//arry/

----

This patch was sent to me privately by Jeethu Rao at Facebook. It's a 
change they're working with internally to improve startup time.? What 
I've been told by Carl Shapiro at Facebook is that we have their 
blessing to post it publicly / merge it / build upon it for CPython.? 
Their patch was written for 3.6, I have massaged it to the point where 
it minimally works with 3.8.

What the patch does: it takes all the Python modules that are loaded as 
part of interpreter startup and deserializes the marshalled .pyc file 
into precreated objects stored as static C data.? You add this .C file 
to the Python build.? Then there's a patch to Python itself (about 250 
lines iirc) that teaches it to load modules from these data structures.

I wrote a quick dumb test harness to compare this patch vs 3.8 stock.? 
It runs a command line 500 times and uses time.perf_counter to time the 
process.? On a fast quiescent laptop I observe a 21-22% improvement:

cmdline: ['./python', '-c', 'pass']
500 runs:

sm38
 ? average time 0.006302303705982922
 ????????? best 0.006055746000129147
 ???????? worst 0.00816565500008437

clean38
 ? average time 0.007969956444008858
 ????????? best 0.007829047999621253
 ???????? worst 0.008812210000542109

improvement 0.20924239043734505 %

cmdline: ['./python', '-c', 'import io']
500 runs:

sm38
 ? average time 0.006297688038004708
 ????????? best 0.005980765999993309
 ???????? worst 0.0072462130010535475

clean38
 ? average time 0.007996319670004595
 ????????? best 0.0078091849991324125
 ???????? worst 0.009175700999549008

improvement 0.21242667903482038 %


The downside of the patch: for these modules it ignores the Python files 
on disk--it doesn't even stat them.? If you add stat calls you lose half 
of the speed improvement.? I believe they added a work-around, where you 
can set a flag (command-line? environment variable? I don't know, I 
didn't go looking for it) that tells Python "don't use the frozen 
modules" and it loads all those files from disk.


I don't propose to merge the patch in its current state.? I think it 
would need a lot of work both in terms of "doing things the way Python 
does it" as well as just code smell (the serializer is implemented in 
both C and Python and jumps back and forth, also the build process for 
the serialized modules is pretty tiresome).

Is it worth working on?

I assume that should be 21.2 % othewise I recommend you abandon the
idea. ;-P

Having a command-line/env var to turn this on/off would be an
acceptable fix, IMHO.  If I'm running Python a server, I don't need
to be editing .py modules and have them be recognized.  Maybe have
it turned off by default, at least at first.

> Is it worth working on?

I wonder how much of the speedup relies on putting it in the data
segment (i.e. using linker/loader to essentially handle the
unmarshal).  What if you had a new marshal format that only needed a
light 2nd pass in order to fix up the data loaded from disk?  Yuri
suggested looking at formats like Cap'n Proto.  If the cost of the
2nd pass was not bad, you wouldn't have to rely on the platform C
toolchain.  Instead we can write .pyc files that hold this data.

Then the speedup can work on all compiled Python modules, not just
the ones you go through the special process that links them into the
data segment.  I suppose that might mean that .pyc files become arch
specific.  Maybe that's okay.

As you said last night, there doesn't seem to be much low hanging
fruit around anymore.  So, 21% looks pretty decent.

Regards,

  Neil

Yeah, that thing you said.

Some experimentation would be in order.? I can suggest that, based on 
conversation from Carl, that adding the stat calls back in costs you 
half the startup.? So any mechanism where we're talking to the disk _at 
all_ simply isn't going to be as fast.

Okay, so if we use hundreds of small .pyc files scattered all over
the disk, that's bad?  Who would have thunk it. ;-P

We could have a new format, .pya (compiled python archive) that has
data for many .pyc files in it.  In normal runs you would have one
or just and handlful of these things (e.g. one for stdlib, one for
your app and all the packages it uses).  Then you mmap these just
once and rely on OS page faults to bring in the data as you need it.
The .pya would have a hash table at the start or end that tells you
the offset for each module.

Over a year ago, I made a pull request (
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/1325) to fix a long-standing issue
with how Python handles dispatch for arithmetic binary operations involving
subclasses (https://bugs.python.org/issue30140).

I pinged the bug several times, but I'm still waiting for a review, which
would be greatly appreciated!

Isn't that essentially what putting the stdlib in a zipfile does? (See
the windows embedded distribution for an example). It probably uses
normal IO rather than mmap, but maybe adding a "use mmap" flag to the
zipfile module would be a more general enhancement that zipimport
could use for free.

I just got caught up on the thread. This is a really great discussion.
Thank you for all the contributions.

Before we get into the details, let's go back to the main use case we are
trying to solve.
*As a user, I am writing an academic paper and I need to cite Python. *

Let's throw reproducibility out the window for now (<--- something I never
thought I would say), because that should be captured in the code, not in
the citations.

So, if we don't need the specific version of Python, then maybe creating
one citation is all we need.
And that gives it some good Google juice as well.

Thoughts?

(Once we nail down one or many, I think we can then move into the details
of the content of the citation.)

with the greatest centrality.

well, Python does evolve over time, so depending on why you are citing it,
version may matter.

But i suggest hat the language reference be used as the "primary" citation
for Python, and then you can cite the version that is current at the time
of your paper writing (Or the version that's relevant to your paper).

And that gives it some good Google juice as well.

What about the R approach?

To cite R in publications use:

  R Core Team (2018). R: A language and environment for statistical
  computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
  URL https://www.R-project.org/.

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},

We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it
when using it for data analysis. See also ?citation("pkgname")? for
citing R packages.

I don't understand the meaning of "need" and "Python".  To understand
your code, one likely needs the Language Reference and surely the
Library Reference, and probably documentation of the APIs and
semantics of various third party code.

To just give credit to the Python project for the suite of tools
you've used, a citation like the R Project's should do (I think this
has appeared more than once, I copy it from Jos? Mar?a Mateos's
parallel post):

 > To cite R in publications use:

I guess for Python that would be something like

"""
Python Core Developers [2018].  Python: A general purpose language for
computing, with batteries included.  Python Software Foundation,
Beaverton, OR.  https://www.python.org/.
"""

I like R's citation() builtin.

One caveat: I get the impression that the R Project is far more
centralized than Python is, that there are not huge independent
projects like SciPy and NumPy and Twisted and so on, nor independent
implementations of the core language like PyPy and Jython.  So I
suspect that for most serious scientific computing you would need to
cite one or more third-pary projects as well, and perhaps an
implementation such as PyPy or Jython.

Jacqueline again:

Do you realize that `3 / 2` means different computations depending on
the version of Python?  And that `"a string"` produces different
objects with different duck-types depending on the version?

As far as handling versions, this would do, I think:

f"""
Python Core Developers [{release_year}].  Python: A general purpose
language for computing, with batteries included, version
{version_number}.  Python Software Foundation, Beaverton, OR.
Project URL: https://www.python.org/.

There's probably already been an ANN announce about this?

If not, someone with appropriate security posture and syntax could address:

Whether python.org binaries are already rebuilt

Whether OS package binaries are already rebuilt

Whether anaconda binaries are already rebuilt

Whether C extension binaries on pypi are already rebuilt

Yeah, it's close to the same thing.  If the syscalls are what gives
the speedup, using a better zipfile implementation might give nearly
the same benefit.

At the sprint we dicussed a variation of Larry's (FB's) patch.
Allow the frozen data to be in DLLs as well as in the python
executable data segment.  So, importlib would be frozen into the
exe.  The standard library could become another DLL.  The user could
provide one or more DLLs that contains their app code and package
deps.  In general, I think there would only be two DLLs: stdlib and
app+deps.

My suggestion of a special format (similar to zipfile) was
motivated by the wish to avoid platform build tools.  E.g. Windows
users would have a harder time to build DLLs.  However, I now think
depending on platform build tools is fine.  The people who will
build these DLLs will have the tools and skills to do so.  Even if
there is only a DLLs for the stdlib, it will be a win.  If no DLLs
are provided, you get the same behavior as current Python (i.e.
importlib is frozen in, everything else can come from .py files).

I think there is no question that Larry's PR will be faster than the
zipfile approach.  It removes the umarshal step.  Maybe that benefit
will but small but I think it should count.  Also, I suspect the OS
can page-in the DLL on-demand and perhaps leave parts of module .pyc
data on disk.  Larry had the idea of keeping code objects frozen
until they need to be executed.  It's a cool idea that would be
enabled by this first step.

I'm excited about Larry's PR.  I think if we get it cleanup up and
into Python 3.8, we will clearly leave Python 2.7 behind in terms of
startup performance.  That has been a goal of mine for a couple
years now.

Regards,

  Neil

I think it's of limited interest if it only helps with modules used
during the startup sequence, not arbitrary stdlib or third-party
modules.

To give an idea, on my machine the baseline Python startup is about 20ms
(`time python -c pass`), but if I import Numpy it grows to 100ms, and
with Pandas it's more than 200ms.  Saving 4ms on the baseline startup
would make no practical difference for concrete usage.

I'm ready to think there are other use cases where it matters, though.

Regards

Antoine.

RE: Why cite Python?.

I would say that in this paper ?
http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/pdfs/jacqueline_kazil.pdf,
where we introduced a new library, we should have cited Python, because the
library was based in Python. We were riding on the coattails of Python and
if Python did not exist, then this library would not exist.

(taking this a level higher)
Just as someone doing research (a specific application) should cite the
Mesa library. Without the good and bad that is Mesa, their research would
have taken a different form.

Since my Ph.D is on Mesa, I will be citing Python there.

I think for more insight we can look at who has cited some of Guido?s stuff?
For example:
https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=900267235435084077&as_sdt=20005&sciodt=0,9&hl=en

Does that help?
RE: Just like R - Versions

@Stephen
Are you suggesting major versions or minor versions?
RE: Guido?s prio works

Some of those have weight already. Should we be picking one those and
pointing people to that?
Final decision

I am going to the NumFocus summit for maintainers of Science Python
libraries next week. I believe that the Science Python community is where
the main audience for this is? correct me if you think this is a wrong
assumption.

I thought I could take two to three concrete formats and user test there
and report on how community members who would be using the citation feel.

Good idea? Bad idea?

I think the "why" in this case should be a bit deeper than that, because
until recently, it's been somewhat unusual to cite the /tools you use/
to create a paper.

I see three major reasons why people cite software packages, and the
form of the citation would have different requirements for each one:

1. *Academic credit / Academic use metrics*

The weird way that academia has evolved, academics are largely judged by
their publications and how influential those publications are. A lot of
the people who work on statistical and scientific python libraries are
doing excellent and incredibly influential work, but that's largely
invisible to the metrics used by funding and tenure committees, so
there's been an effort do things like getting DOIs for libraries or
publishing articles in journals like the journal of open source
software: https://joss.theoj.org

Then you cite the libraries if you use them, and the people who
contribute to the work can say, "Look I'm a regular contributor to this
core library that is cited in 90% of papers". This seems less important
to CPython, where the majority of core contributors (as far as I can
tell) are not academics and have little use for high h-index papers.
That said, even if no one involved cares about the academic credit, if
every paper that used Python cited the language, it probably /would/
provide useful metrics to the PSF and others interested in this.

If all you want is a formal way to say "I used Python for this" as a
citation so that it can be tracked, then a single DOI for the entire
language should be sufficient.

2. *As a primary source or example for some claims
*

If you are writing an article about language design and you are
referencing how Python handles async or scoping or unicode or something,
you want to make it easy for your readers to see the context of your
statement, to verify that it's true and to get more details than you
might want to include as part of what may be a tangential mention in
your paper. I have a sense that this is closer to the original reason
people cited things in papers and books before citations became a metric
for measuring influence - and subsequently a way to give credit for the
source of ideas.

If this is why you are citing Python, you should probably be citing a
specific sub-section of the language reference and/or documentation, and
that citation should probably be versioned, since new features are added
in every minor version, and the way some of these things are handled may
change over time. In this case, a separate DOI for each minor version
that points to the documentation as built by a specific commit or git
tag or whatever would probably be ideal.

3. *To aid reproducibility*

It won't go all the way towards reproducing your research, but given
that Python is a living language that is always changing - both in
implementation and the spec itself - to the extent that you have a
"methods" section, it should probably include things like operating
system version, CPython version and the versions of all libraries you
used so that if someone is failing to replicate your results, they know
how to build an environment where it /should work/.

If you want to include this information in the form of a citation, then
I would think that you would not want to be both more granular - citing
the specific interpreter you used (CPython, Jython, Pypy), the full
version (3.6.6 rather than 3.6) and possibly even other factors like
operating system, etc, and /less/ granular in that you don't need to
cite a specific subset of the interpreter (e.g. async), but just the
interpreter as a whole.

--

My thoughts on the matter are that I think the CPython core dev team
probably cares a lot less about #1 than, say, the R dev team, which is
one reason why there's no clear way to cite "CPython" as a whole.

I think that #3 is a very laudable goal, but probably should be in some
sort of "methods" section of the document being prepared rather than
overloading citations for it, though having a standardized way to
describe your Python setup (similar to, say, the pandas debugging
feature `pandas.show_versions()`) that is optimized for publication
would probably be super helpful.

While #2 is probably only a small fraction of all the times where people
would want to "cite CPython", I think it's probably the most important
one, since it's performing a very specific function useful to the reader
of the paper. It also seems not terribly difficult to come up with some
guidance for unambiguously referencing sections of the documentation
and/or language reference, and having "get a DOI for the documentation"
be part of the release cycle.

Best,
Paul

P.S. I will also be at the NumFocus summit. It's been some time since
I've been an academic, but hopefully there will be an interesting
discussion about this there!

Are there different CFLAGS and/or gcc compatibility flags in conda builds
of Python and C extensions?

Where are those set in conda builds?

What's the best way to set CFLAGS in Python builds and C extensions?

export CFLAGS="-mindirect-branch=thunk -mindirect-branch-register"
./configure
make

?

Why are we supposed to use an old version of GCC that doesn't have the
retpoline patches that only mitigate Spectre variant 2?

Are all current Python builds and C extensions vulnerable to Spectre

I wanted to start with an easy answer that is surely unsatisfying:
http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2015/01/how-to-cite-software-in-apa-style.html

APA style is pretty popular, and it says that standard software doesn't
need to be specified. Standard software includes "Microsoft Word, Java, and
Adobe Photoshop." So I'd say Python fits well in that category, and doesn't
need to be cited.

I said you wouldn't be satisfied...

The goal here is ambiguous. Python means many things--a language described
by the language specification, the source code of a particular
implementation of the language (Python often refers to C Python), a
particular binary release of the implementation of the language (Python
1.5.2 for Windows). Which one is relevant in the context of the paper? If
you're talking about a bug in timsort in a particular version of C Python,
then you probably want to cite that specific version of the implementation.

I suspect the most common goal for a citation is just to describe the
language "in general" where 1.5.2 or 3.7.0 and Jython or CPython are all
details that don't matter. In that case I'd cite the language
specification. We're talking about putting a citation in a paper (a written
source) and the written language specification captures what we think of as
essential for the language. If you want to cite Turing's proof of the
undecidability of the halting problem, you'd cite the paper where he wrote
it down (in Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society). If you want to
cite a programming language in the abstract, cite the specification that
describes it.

I think style guides are relevant here. They give guidance on how to cite
an item based on its category. For example, the MLA style guide describes
how to cite a digital file, a physical object, and many other things. My
favorite example under "physical object" is "Physical objects found
online." (Think about it :-).

There's some discussion of how to cite source code here:
http://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code. Notably this is talking
about citing source code in the context of other source code, and it mostly
recommends using URLs. If you wanted to cite a particular piece of source
code in an written article, you'd probably follow one of the approaches for
citing online resources. Try to identify who / when / what / where. For
example MLA style for a blog post would be : Editor, screen name, author,
or compiler name (if available). ?Posting Title.? Name of Site, Version
number (if available), Name of institution/organization affiliated with the
site (sponsor or publisher), URL. Date of access. You could cite a
particular source file this way or a particular source release.

The date usually refers to the original publication date. I think that was
with the 1.0 release, although I'm not sure. I'd probably pick that date,
but someone can correct me if there's an earlier date. It would suggest
somehow that current Python and the original Python were mostly the same
thing, which is an idea I like.

van Rossum, Guido (1994). "The Python Language Reference". Python Software
Foundation, https://docs.python.org/reference/index.html. Retrieved 16
September 2018.

I'd say that's all settled. If anyone asks you, "How can you be sure that
settles it?" You can answer, "Some guy said it on a mailing list." And then
you can site the message:

Subject: [Python-Dev] debugging test_importlib.test_bad_traverse - script
 status is SUCCESS - but FAIL is expected.
Message-ID: <10c3d2a1-85e3-5747-77a2-8c282565e8ce@felt.demon.nl>

I read the discussion related to issue32374. That seems to be sure that
other events that could
cause the test to fail (i.e., the program executes successfully) are
caught early, and/or ignored
so that the program fails - and the test succeeds.

I am having trouble figuring out why the script below does not fail on
AIX, and would appreciate your assistance in debugging what is
happening, i.e., getting deeper.

Many thanks!

To make sure the full debug info is loaded I added "-X dev", and for
your reading
added some additional print statements - and for speed run the command
directly.
Regardless of how I run it (calling as a test, or directly) the
end-result is the same.

To get some additional idea of what is happening I added some fprintf
statements:

The additional debug info is: (see diff below)
1. bad_traverse:0
2. bad_traverse:0
1. bad_traverse:0
2. bad_traverse:0
1. bad_traverse:0
2. bad_traverse:0

*** To my SURPRISE *** only one routine with these print statements is
ever called.
I was expecting at more. (only bad_traverse(...) gets called, I was
expecting
both bad_traverse_test (Objects/moduleobject.c) and some kind of
initialization
of m_state->integer.

Since the macro Py_VISIT includes a return() statement, and my debug
statement always print the
second line - I assume Py_VISIT(m_state->integer) is not doing anything
(i.e., vret == 0)

/* Utility macro to help write tp_traverse functions.
?* To use this macro, the tp_traverse function must name its arguments
?* "visit" and "arg".? This is intended to keep tp_traverse functions
?* looking as much alike as possible.

Is this what it should be?

Hi,

Please don't cross-post so heavily.  python-dev is sufficient for this.

If you want to push this forward, I suggest you measure performance of
Python compiled with and without the Spectre mitigation options, and
report the results here.  That will help vendors and packagers decide
whether they want to pursue the route of enabling those options.

Note there are plenty of data-driven conditional jumps in Python.  It
will not be easy to determine which ones are vulnerable to exploiting
through speculative execution of a mispredicted branch.  The bytecode
evaluation loop sounds like a potential attack target, but it's also
performance-sensitive.

Regards

Antoine.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Nearly - all tests PASS for AIX
Message-ID: <908465e6-d28b-a4ec-d687-1ff3826e7e84@felt.demon.nl>

Dear all,

The last two months I have spent nearly all my free time to cleanup "a
frustration" - from my side - the long list of failing tests for AIX
(there were nearly 20 when I started).

atm - I am stuck on one - test_importlib (mail elsewhere), and the one I
just finished (test_httpservers) may be overly simplified (just skipping
the trailing-slash tests) - see issue34711 for a discussion. I would be
grateful for feedback before I post it as a PR - to avoid working in
circles.

I hope you, the developers and development-minded community consider in
a useful contribution.

Currently - with all my proposed patches combined I have:

393 tests OK.

1 test failed:
??? test_importlib

25 tests skipped:
??? test_dbm_gnu test_devpoll test_epoll test_gdb test_idle
??? test_kqueue test_lzma test_msilib test_ossaudiodev test_readline
??? test_spwd test_sqlite test_startfile test_tcl test_tix test_tk
??? test_ttk_guionly test_ttk_textonly test_turtle test_unicode_file
??? test_unicode_file_functions test_winconsoleio test_winreg
??? test_winsound test_zipfile64

1 re-run test:
??? test_importlib

Awaiting comments and suggestions. Many thanks for your time.

Michael Felt

I investigated this thoroughly some time ago (when the MSVC flags became 
available) and determined (with the help of some of the original 
Spectre/Meltdown investigation team) that there is no significant value 
in enabling these flags for Python.

It boiled down to:
* Python allows arbitrary code execution by design
* Pure Python code in CPython has very long per-instruction opcode 
sequences that cannot easily be abused or timed
* Injected pure Python code cannot be coerced into generating native 
code that is able to abuse Spectre/Meltdown but not able to abuse other 
attacks more easily
* Code injection itself is outside of this particular threat model

By comparison with JavaScript, most JS JITs can be easily coerced into 
generating specific native code that can break sandbox guarantees (e.g. 
browser tabs). Python offers none of these guarantees.

Distributors are of course free to enable these flags for their own 
builds, but I recommend against it for the official binaries, and would 
suggest that it's worth more PR than actual security and nobody else 
needs to enable it either.

(Extension authors with significant scriptable C code need to perform 
their own analysis. I'm only talking about CPython here.)

Cheers,
Steve

It goes on to say """Note: We don?t keep a comprehensive list of what

What did you fuzz with?
Does that assume that e.g. Fortify has identified all bugs in CPython C?
There have been a number of variants that have been disclosed; which did
who test for?

Yet binaries built with GCC do have NX? Unless nested functions in C
extensions?

A demonstration of this would be helpful.

 So, not impossible.

* Code injection itself is outside of this particular threat model


[Jupyter] Notebook servers are as wide open to arbitrary code execution as
browser JS JITs; often with VMs and/or containers as a 'sandbox'

`pip install requirements.txt` installs and executes unsigned code: Python,
C extensions

What can a container do to contain a speculative execution exploit
intending to escape said container?

I thought I read that RH has a kernel flag for userspace?

This is faulty logic. Because Python does not have a JIT sandbox,
speculative execution is not a factor for Python?

Extension installers (and authors) are not likely to perform any such
analysis.

Extensions are composed of arbitrary C, which certainly can both directly
exploit and indirectly enable remote exploitation of Spectre and Meltdown
vulnerabilities.

Most users of python are installing arbitrary packages (without hashes or
signatures).

I don't know anything about GCC settings. Binaries for Windows have been 
built with this option for over a decade. It's unrelated to 
Spectre/Meltdown.

That's not how proof-of-concepts work. You can't assume that the lack of 
a demonstration proves it is possible - at best you have to assume that 
it proves it is *not* possible, but really it just proves that nobody 
has a demonstration yet.

What I could demonstrate (again) if I thought it would be worthwhile is 
that the changes enabled by the flag do not affect the normal 
interpreter loop, and do not affect any code that can be called fast 
enough to potentially leak information. Feel free to go ahead and build 
with/without the flags and compare the disassembly (and if you do this 
and find that compilers are detecting new cases since I looked, *that* 
would be very helpful to share directly with the security team).

Of course it's not impossible. But why would you

Python's threat model does not treat the Python process as a sandbox. To 
say it another way, if you assume the Python process is a sandbox, 
you're on your own.

Arbitrary code, Python or otherwise, can totally escape the process, and 
then it's up to the OS to protect against escaping the machine. We do 
what we can to reduce unnecessary arbitrary code, but unless you've 
properly protected your environment then you have a lot more to worry 
about besides speculative execution vulnerabilities.

Because Python does not have a (native) JIT at all, speculative 
execution relies on identifying vulnerable and reusable code patterns 
within the C code and being able to invoke those directly. Because pure 
Python code does not allow this (without relying on other bugs), there 
is no way to do this within the threat model we use.

Once you allow arbitrary or unvalidated native code, you are outside the 
threat model and hence on your own. And if you find a bug that lets pure 
Python code move the instruction pointer to arbitrary native code, that 
should be reported to the security team.

Then it is their fault if they are compromised. Open source software 
relies on users validating the software themselves, as there is no legal 
recourse against developers who do not do it.

If arbitrary C is running, we can't help you anymore.

If they are concerned about Spectre/Meltdown, they should stop doing 
this. They should also stop if they are concerned about 1000 other 
issues that are much more likely than Spectre/Meltdown.

Hi Wes,

It's great you're passionate about python security, but this is the wrong
way to go about it. Spectre is inherently super subtle and confusing, so if
there's something that people need to do, then we need a clear,
comprehensive write-up of what the threat is and how to address it. Perhaps
you could find some collaborators with expertise in these things and work
with them off-list to put something like that together ? that could be
quite helpful.

What isn't helpful is what you've been doing instead: sending incoherent
jumbles of vaguely-related text, to multiple highly-subscribed mailing
lists, multiple times a day, for a week now. This is worse than useless.
Please stop.

To summarize:

- CPython may be vulnerable to speculative execution vulnerabilities, but
none are known.
- In general, CPython is currently too slow for speculative execution
exploitation to be practical.
  - Sandboxed, JIT'ed JS is not too slow for speculative execution
exploitation to be practical
    - (Not otherwise discussed here: PyPy's sandboxed JIT may not be too
slow for speculative execution exploitation to be practical.)

- C extensions may be vulnerable to speculative execution vulnerabilities;
but that's the authors' and users' problem (and so it's appropriate to
mention this to extension owners following distutils-sig/PyPA)
  - C extensions can set indirect branch CFLAGS only with GCC 7.3 and GCC
8+; which are only usable with conda and the forthcoming manylinux2010 spec

- Linux kernels with [IBRS, STIBP, IBPB] can enable userspace protection
- The revised worst-case performance impacts for variant 2 mitigations are
4-8%

- MSVC has a /Qspectre flag for variant 1

- Because there is no exploit provided (or currently thought possible with
just CPython), this security-related dialogue is regarded as a nuisance.
- There is no published or official statement or investigation from the
Python community regarding Spectre (or Meltdown) vulnerabilities.

Here's a good write-up:
Safety_instructions_for_Meltdown_and_Spectre

Have a good day!

This should help any use-case that is already using the freeze module
already bundled with CPython.  Third-party code, like py2exe, py2app,
pyinstaller, and XAR could build upon this to create applications that
start faster.

Do you have a feeling for how many of those milliseconds are spend loading
bytecode from disk?  If so standalone executables that contain numpy and
pandas (and mercurial) would start faster

I think so.  I hope you will, too :-)

I am having so much fun learning python! I did not install the best version
into my mac at first. Now I can't find out how to upgrade, (pip is awesome
but not as conversational as I need it to be on the subject). I've
downloaded the packages from python.org, installed all sorts of stuff,  I
configured my text editor to recognize python3, resolving formatting
strings output, but now as I progress the

is not recognized. I have figured out a lot on my own, can you help me
upgrade to 3.6 once and for all? Again I consulted with pip and followed

Subject: [Python-Dev] Late Python 3.7.1 changes to fix the C locale coercion
 (PEP 538) implementation
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGHcMS1koGpWOW95MwD22C56S51Xm5xKbcZ6SPqPSu9aYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Unicode and locales lovers,

tl; dr Nick, Ned, INADA-san: I modified 3.7.1 to add a new "-X
coerce_c_locale=value" option and make sure that the C locale coercion
cannot be when Python in embedded: are you ok with these changes?


Before 3.7.0 release, during the implementation of the UTF-8 Mode (PEP
540), I changed two things in Nick Coghlan's implementation of the C
locale coercion (PEP 538):

(1) PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE environment variable is now ignored when -E or
-I command line option is used.

(2) When Python is embeded, the C locale coercion is now enabled if
the LC_CTYPE locale is "C".

Nick asked me to change the behavior:
https://bugs.python.org/issue34589

I just pushed this change in the 3.7 branch which adds a new "-X
coerce_c_locale=value" option:
https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/144f1e2c6f4a24bd288c045986842c65cc289684

Examples using Pyhon 3.7 (future 3.7.1) with UTF-8 Mode disabled, to
only test the C locale coercion:
---
$ cat test.py
import codecs, locale
enc = locale.getpreferredencoding()
enc = codecs.lookup(enc).name
print(enc)

$ export LC_ALL= LC_CTYPE=C LANG=

# Disable C locale coercion: get ASCII as expected
$ PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=0 ./python -X utf8=0 test.py
ascii

# -E ignores PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=0:
# C locale is coerced, we get UTF-8
$ PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=0 ./python -E -X utf8=0 test.py
utf-8

# -X coerce_c_locale=0 is not affected by -E:
# C locale coercion disabled as expected, get ASCII as expected
$ ./python -E -X utf8=0 -X coerce_c_locale=0 test.py
ascii
---


For (1), Nick's use case is to get Python 3.6 behavior (C locale not
coerced) on Python 3.7 using PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE. Nick proposed to use
PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE even with -E or -I, but I dislike introducing a
special case for -E option.

I chose to add a new "-X coerce_c_locale=0" to Python 3.7.1 to provide
a solution for this use case. (Python 3.7.0 and older ignore this
option.)

Note: Python 3.7.0 is fine with PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=0, we are only
talking about the special case of -E and -I options.


For (2), I modified Python 3.7.1 to make sure the C locale is never
coerced when the C API is used to embed Python inside an application:
Py_Initialize() and Py_Main(). The C locale can only be coerced by the
official Python program ("python3.7").

I don't know if it should be possible to enable C locale coercion when
Python is embedded. So I just made the change requested by Nick :-)


I dislike doing such late changes in 3.7.1, especially since PEP 538
has been designed by Nick Coghlan, and we disagree on the fix. But Ned
Deily, our Python 3.7 release manager, wants to see last 3.7 fixes
merged before Tuesday, so here we are.


Nick, Ned, INADA-san: are you ok with these changes?


The other choices for 3.7.1 are:

* Revert my change: C locale coercion can still be enabled when Python
is embedded, -E option ignores PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE env var.

* Revert my change and apply Nick's PR 9257: C locale coercion cannot
be enabled when Python is embedded and -E option doesn't ignore
PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE env var.


I spent months to fix the master branch to support all possible

Just because the 3.7.1rc is scheduled doesn't mean we should throw something in, particularly if it's not fully reviewed and fully agreed upon.  If it's important enough, we could delay the rc a few days ... or decide to wait for 3.7.2.

I would like to see Nick review the merged 3.7 PR and have both him and you agree that this is the thing to do for 3.7.1.  I also want to make sure we understand what affect this will have on 3.7.0 users.  Let's not potentially make things worse.

I'm not planning to tag 3.7.1rc for at least another 18 hours.  I'm marking bpo-34589 as "release blocker" and I will not proceed until this is resolved.

Thanks!

Python-dev is for development *of* Python, not *in* Python! You want
python-list instead.

Also, make sure you include some full example code where the error occurs
and what exactly is failing. Right now, it's hard for me to tell what
exactly is going on...

I'm no security researcher, and I barely remember much about
Spectre/Meltdown, but I think the idea is that, if Python takes about
2 milliseconds to run your code, then a difference of +- 10
microseconds is indistinguishable from noise. Try to write software
that can learn to distinguish two similar computers using the running
time of certain functions.

Javascript can be crafted to get close enough to some C programs.
ASM.js and WebAssembly might help.

PyPy's need for mitigation is independent of CPython's.

> - Because there is no exploit provided (or currently thought possible with just CPython), this security-related dialogue is regarded as a nuisance.

More than that. Steve says that he looked into it and decided there
wasn't really anything to worry about. He believes that any exploit of
it will also imply an easier exploit is possible. He also says that
this particular fix won't really help.

Nathaniel is annoyed because Spectre is tricky to understand, and he
assumes you don't understand it as well as you think because you
haven't shown him that you have the expertise to understand it.

> Here's a good write-up:
> Safety_instructions_for_Meltdown_and_Spectre

But how does that apply to CPython? What specifically about CPython
makes the interpreter vulnerable to the attack? Under what conditions
would CPython be vulnerable to this attack, but not an easier attack
of at least the same severity?

The article I linked at the top of this email does not give advice for
interpreter writers at all. It only says what end users and chip
manufacturers ought to do. It is not relevant.

As far as I know, execution speed is important for attacker, not victim.
In case of JavaScript, browser may load attacking code and run it while
user watching websites.
Browsers provides sandbox for JS, but attacker code may be able to
bypass the sandbox by Spectre or Meltdown.  So browsers disabled
high precision timer until OSes are updated.

This topic is totally unrelated to compiler options: these compiler options
doesn't prohibit running attacking code, it just guard branches from
branch target injection.

Does my understanding collect?  Why should we discuss about execution speed?

I think this topic should split to two topics: (1) Guard Python
process from Spectre/Meltdown
attack from other process, (2) Prohibit Python code attack other
processes by using
Spectre/Meltdown.

No idea.  In my previous experiments with module import speed, I
concluded that executing module bytecode generally was the dominating
contributor, but that doesn't mean loading bytecode is costless.

After reading below, I would appreciate knowing whether to ask that
issue32374 be reopened and the test adjusted so that the test is
"SkipIf" AIX? Or, something else? I'll work on something else, but I do
not want to guess the current intent of this test module.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Request review of bpo-34125/GH-8416
Message-ID: <5BA0D4CA.7040302@UGent.be>

The gist of bpo-34125 is that the following two statements behave 
differently with respect to sys.setprofile() profiling:

 >>> list.append([], None)

 >>> list.append([], None, **{})

More precisely: the former call is profiled, but the latter is not. The 
fix at GH-8416 is simply to make this consistent by also profiling the 
latter.

Victor Stinner did not want to accept the pull request because he wanted 
"a wider discussion on function calls". I think that GH-8416 is a simple 
bugfix which can be merged anyway and which won't make future 
"discussions on function calls" any harder.

In any case, it would be good to have any *decision* (accepted or 
rejected) on that PR. I find the current uncertainty worse than a 
decision either way. Right now, my reference implementation of PEP 580 
conflicts with that branch and I would like to resolve that conflict 
after GH-8416 has been decided.

I think this seems like a great idea.

Some questions though:

During the import process, Python can already deal with folders and .zip
files in sys.path... now, instead of having special handling for a new
concept with a custom command line, etc, why not just say that this is a
special file (e.g.: files with a .pyfrozen extension) and make importlib be
able to deal with it when it's on sys.path (that way there could be
multiple of those and there should be no need to turn it on/off, custom
command line, etc)?

Another question: doesn't importlib already provide hooks for external
contributors which could address that use case? (so, this could initially
be available as a third party library for maturing outside of CPython and
then when it's deemed to be mature it could be integrated into CPython --
not that this can't happen on Python 3.8 timeframe, but it'd be useful
checking its use against the current Python version and measuring benefits
with real world code).

To give an idea, on my machine the baseline Python startup is about 20ms

393 tests OK.

1 test altered the execution environment:
??? test_threading

25 tests skipped:
??? test_dbm_gnu test_devpoll test_epoll test_gdb test_idle
??? test_kqueue test_lzma test_msilib test_ossaudiodev test_readline
??? test_spwd test_sqlite test_startfile test_tcl test_tix test_tk
??? test_ttk_guionly test_ttk_textonly test_turtle test_unicode_file
??? test_unicode_file_functions test_winconsoleio test_winreg
??? test_winsound test_zipfile64

Total duration: 13 min 30 sec
Tests result: SUCCESS

May I put this up as a PR - not for merging - but to see how it
performs, or does not perform, with the Travis Ci, etc. tests?

Regards,

Michael

p.s. - most of the time test_threading just passes. Going to Rinse and
repeat!

My observations might not be so different.  On a large application, we
measured ~25-30% of start-up time being spent in the loading of compiled
bytecode.  That includes: probing the filesystem, reading the bytecode off
disk, allocating heap storage, and un-marshaling objects into the heap.

Making that percentage go to ~0% using this change does not make the
non-import parts of our module body functions execute faster.  It does
create a greater opportunity for the application developer to do less work
in module body functions which is where the largest start-up time gains are
now likely to happen.

That is an interesting idea but it might not be easy to work into this
design.  The improvement in start-up time comes from eliminating the
overheads of filesystem I/O, memory allocation, and un-marshaling
bytecode.  Having this data on the filesystem would reintroduce the cost of
filesystem I/O and it would add a load-time relocation to the equation so
the overall performance benefits would be greatly lessened.

This may be possible but, for the same reasons I outline above, it would
certainly come at the expense of performance.

I think many people are interested in a better .pyc format but our goals
are much more modest.  We are actually trying to not introduce a whole new
way to externalize .py data in CPython.  Rather, we think of this as just
making the existing frozen module capability much faster so its use can be
broadened to making start-up performance better.  The user visible part,
the command line interface to bypass the frozen module, would be a
nice-to-have for developers but is something we could live without.

The primary benefit of the importlib hook approach is that it would not 
require rebuilding CPython each time you make a change. Since we need to 
consider a wide range of users across a wide range of platforms, having 
the ability to load a single native module that contains many 
"pre-loaded" modules allows many more people to access the benefits.

It would not prevent some specific modules from being compiled into the 
main binary, but for those who do not build their own Python it would 
also allow specific applications to use the feature as well.

FWIW, I don't read this as being pushed back on Carl to implement before 
the idea is accepted. I think we're taking the (now proven) core idea 
and shaping it into a suitable form for the main CPython distribution, 
which has to take more use cases into account.

Cheers,
Steve

Just to make sure we're in the same page, the approach I'm talking about
would still be having a dll, not a better .pyc format, so, during the
import a custom importer would open that dll once and provide modules from
it -- do you think this would be much more overhead than what's proposed
now?

I guess it may be a bit slower because it'd have to obey the existing
import capabilities, but that shouldn't mean more time is spent on IO,
memory allocation nor un-marshaling bytecode (although it may be that I
misunderstood the approach or the current import capabilities don't provide
the proper api for that).

According to this article, the malicious program needs to act in the
amount of time it takes for the CPU to load a value from memory and

How might people feel about using the linker to bundle a list of pre-loaded
modules into a single-file executable?  That would avoid the inconvenience
of rebuilding all of CPython by shipping a static libpython and having the
tool generate a .o or .S file with the un-marshaled data.  (Linkers and
assemblers are small enough to be bundled on systems that do not have them.)

The users of Python are pretty diverse so it depends on who you ask.
Some would like a giant executable that includes everything they
need (so of like the Go approach).  Other people want an executable
that has just importlib inside it and then mix-and-match different
shared libs for their different purposes.  Some will not want work
"old school" and load from separate .py or .pyc files.

I see no reason why we can't support all these options.
