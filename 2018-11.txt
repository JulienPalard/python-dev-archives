I assume the redundancy was there to handle the naming collision 
problem, but a better way to do that is to have only header files that 
users should ever use in "include/", and put the rest inside 
"include/python/" and "include/internal/" (and if possible, we don't 
distribute the internal directory as part of -develop packages, which 
only really impacts the Windows installer as far as we're concerned, but 
I assume some distros will care).

That would mean a layout like:

include/
   Python.h
   typeslots.h
   Python/
     abstract.h
     ...
   internal/
     pycore_atomic.h
     ...

End users/distutils should only -Iinclude, while our build can 
-Iinclude/Python and -Iinclude/internal as well. Or we can update all of 
our includes to specify the directory (which I'd prefer - #include 
"name.h" should look adjacent to the file first, while #include <name.h> 
looks at search paths first, which should be able to deal with collisions).

Any change here is an improvement, though. I'll be happy for 
Py_BUILD_CORE to go away (or at least only imply -Iinclude/internal, 
rather than actual preprocessor work), no matter where files land 
precisely :)

Cheers,
Steve

Aha, I didn't try this approach. I counted 41 Include/ header files
which are not included by Python.h:

Python-ast.h
abstract.h
asdl.h
ast.h
bitset.h
bytes_methods.h
bytesobject.h
code.h
codecs.h
datetime.h
dictobject.h
dynamic_annotations.h
errcode.h
fileobject.h
frameobject.h
graminit.h
grammar.h
longintrepr.h
marshal.h
metagrammar.h
node.h
opcode.h
osdefs.h
parsetok.h
patchlevel.h
pgen.h
pgenheaders.h
py_curses.h
pydtrace.h
pyexpat.h
pystrhex.h
pythonrun.h
pythread.h
pytime.h
setobject.h
structmember.h
symtable.h
token.h
ucnhash.h
unicodeobject.h

For Py_BUILD_CORE, there is at least datetime.h which may be a
Include/internal/ twin header.

Now I'm not sure how it's going to fit with the second step, "Move
!Py_LIMITED_API to Include/pycapi/":

It seems that is best practice (e.g. look at Linux kernel include
file style).  I wonder however what are the real benefits to having
modular include files and directly using them as needed?

Pros for modular includes:

- speeds up build process if you have good dependency info in the
  build system.  Right now, change Python.h and everything gets
  rebuilt.  I'm not sure this is a huge advantage anymore.

- makes it clearer where an API is implemented?

Cons:

- more work to include the correct headers

- build system dependency definitions are more complicated.  Other
  systems generally have automatic dependancy generates (i.e. parse
  C files and find used includes).

A simple approach would be to introduce something like
Python-internal.h.  If you are a Python internal unit, you can
include both Python.h and Python-internal.h.  We could, over time,
split Python-iternal.h into smaller modular includes.

Since this discussion, I already moved most Py_BUILD_CORE in
Include/internal/. I added a lot of #include "pycore_xxx.h" in C
files.

I started to reach the limit with this PR which adds the
pycore_object.h include to not less than 33 C files:
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10272

I rewrote this PR to avoid the need to modify 33 C files:
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10276/files

I added the following code to Python.h:

#ifdef Py_BUILD_CORE
/* bpo-35081: Automatically include pycore_object.h in Python.h, to avoid
to have to add an explicit #include "pycore_object.h" to each C file. */
# include "pycore_object.h"
#endif

I'm not sure of it's a temporary workaround or not :-) Maybe a
Python-internal.h would be a better solution? We can identify the most
common header files needed to access "Python internals" and put them
in this "common" header file.

For example, most C files using Python internals have to access
_PyRuntime global variable (55 C files), so "pycore_state.h" is a good
candidate.

By the way, I don't understand the rationale to have _PyRuntime in
pycore_state.h. IMHO pycore_state.h should only contain functions to
get the Python thread and Python interpreter states. IMHO _PyRuntime
is unrelated and should belong to a different header file, maybe
pycore_runtime.h? I didn't do this change yet *because* I would have
to modify the 55 files currently including it.

Yes. Visual Studio 2015 or later can be used (and as this is the only 
way to get the compiler right now, I think it's fine to list that as the 
requirement - note that the "Visual Studio Build Tools" installer 
doesn't include the IDE itself).

Feel free to update the wiki.

Cheers,
Steve

Not to derail this thread, but it may be worth looking into something like
Android's network security config (
https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config) in
relation to PEP 543.

One of the key takeaways from their analysis of a large number of
applications which touched TLS libraries was that their developers often
wanted to do simple and sane things but wound up doing complicated and
insane ones. To combat that, they created a fairly lightweight declarative
syntax for allowing narrow deviations from best practice. This syntax does
not have the full flexibility of their API, but is enough to satisfy the
needs of lots of developers and prevent lots of mistakes along the way.

In particular, I'd love to see some examples of how to achieve the same
effects as the canonical network security config examples using a PEP 543
interface. If they're useful enough it may even be beneficial to wrap those
up in a separate library, but at the very least it will help prove out that
PEP 543 can do the most important things that developers will want it to
do. If that already exists and I'm just ignorant of it, sorry for the noise.

Why do we need to refer to the address of objects in memory?

Python's execution model is not based on addresses. We can't get the 
address of an object or do anything with it (except via ctypes). At the 
Python layer, objects just exist, they don't logically exist at any 
addressable location.

In fact, they might not exist in a single location -- compound objects 
are split across many locations or can share chunks of memory between 
multiple objects. Objects in Jython and IronPython can move about, those 
in PyPy can disappear from existence and reappear. The concept that 
every object has exactly one fixed location simply isn't correct.

I understand that people wishing to understand the implementation 
details of CPython objects will need to think about C-level concepts 
like memory address, but at the Python level, "address" is not a very 
meaningful or useful concept.

Message-ID: <20181104133827.GA25586@xps>

Hi all,

When we receive a PR about the documentation, I think that could be
interesting if we could have a running instance of the doc on a sub
domain of python.org.

For example, pr-10000-doc.python.org or whatever, but by this way the
reviewers could see the result online.

The workflow would be like that:

New PR -> build the doc (done by Travis) -> publish it to a server ->
once published, the PR is notified by "doc is available at URL".

Once merged -> we remove the doc and the link (hello bedevere).

I am interested by this feature and if you also interested, tell me.
I would like discuss with Julien Palard and Ernest W.  Durbin III for a
solution as soon as possible.

Have a nice day,

St?phane

It's an interesting idea but I don't like essentially opening python.org as a publishing platform (OK, another publishing platform - yes, I know about wiki.python.org).  Considering how easy it is to build and view the docs yourself, I don't think the benefits of such a service are worth the added complexity and potential abuse.

cd Doc
make venv # first time
git pr checkout ...

open build/html/index.html  # depending on platform and code change

Considering feedback from Ned, what about building this as an independent service? We don't really need to interface with python.org at all, we just need some hardware, a domain, some code to interface with github API and... to start it's probably enough? It would be a usefull POC.

I am going to give your 3 counter-examples but I think you will find an
other counter-example ;-)

1. Two weeks ago, I have opened a PR
[https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10009] about a rewording of a
sentence in the doc. Paul Ganssle was a reviewer and in a sentence he
said that would be nice to have a live preview of the docs on PR.
See https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10009#issuecomment-433082605
Maybe he was on his smartphone/tablet and not in front of his computer.

2. On this morning, I was reviewing a PR
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10102, but the message from the
reviewer was "LGTM. Thanks for the PR ;-)". I don't doubt about the
reviewer but I want to check the result of sphinx and not just the
text, sometimes, we can find an other issue, you never know.

3. On this after-noon, I have reviewed a PR, and I was in the same case,
download the PR, build python, compile the doc and run the local server.

My workflow is the following steps:

git wpr XYZ
cd ../cpython-XYZ
./configure --prefix=$PWD-build --with-pydebug --silent
make -j 4 -s
make PYTHON=../python -C Doc/ venv
make -C Doc/ check suspicious html serve

and run the browser on http://localhost:8000/ and check the result.


1. Because I am a dev I can do it easily
2. If you are not a dev, you have to learn a new step (download sources,
compile sources, compile doc and check the result)

We could check easily the result without this big step.

git wpr -> wpr = !bash -c \"git fetch upstream pull/${1}/head:pr_${1} && git worktree add ../$(basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel))-pr-${1} pr_${1}\" -

I think this feature would be really useful for the contributors, the
reviewers and you, the core-dev.

After running 'make html', the build directory is the entire site as a

with GitHub Pages. I already have a script that will push a directory
up as the gh-pages branch of the current repo; it'd just need a tweak
so it can push to a specific repo, which you could create on GitHub
for the purpose. Not 100% automatic, but also not too difficult to
automate, if needed.

+1

We have 2 options

1. We keep a domain (python.org, or another one) and for each build we would have a subdomain for
each build by PR.
doc-pr-XYZ.domain.tld

2. We could store on domain but with a subdirectory by PR
domain.tld/doc-pr-XYZ

In travis, I think we have the PR info, we could use it and upload to
the server for the live preview.

Once merged, we drop the temporary doc on the server.

Nice idea, but I am not for that.

1. We will populate the git repository with a lot of gh-pages branches
and I am not for this solution
2. This static doc is just temporary, once merged, we have to remove the
link and the content on the server, with the gh-pages, that will be a
commit where we drop the content, but it's a commit and we will consume
the storage of github.
3. 1 repo has only one gh-pages, in our case, we need to have a lot of
gh-pages for a repo.

But thank you for your idea.

I can trivially attach the built docs as a ZIP file to the Azure 
Pipelines build, though that doesn't help the "preview on my phone" 
scenario (unless your phone can extract and then open a directory of 
HTML files? Mine can't)

But that's also easy enough to tie into a second step to deploy the 
files practically anywhere. Pushing them to a git repo based on the PR 
name is easy, and presumably it can be a single repo with directories 
for different PRs? It might need a separate job to periodically clean it 
up, but this seems very doable.

Cheers,
Steve

This will just move risks to this service.

Ned mentioned potential abuse. We will host unchecked content. Malicious 
user can create a PR which replaces Python documentation with malicious 
content.

The Doc/ directory includes Python scripts and Makefile which are used 
for building documentation. Malicious user can use this for executing 
arbitrary code on our server.

Or just upload the zip file to the server-live-preview-doc and unzip the
result.

for the subdirectory by PR I am not sure but we could have an issue with
the cache of the browser because we will use the same domain, but this
solution can be created in few hours. +1

For the subdomain, no problem with the cache, just update the DNS, but
we can have an issue with the propagation of the DNS if the TTL is high.

We could use Bedevere, not sure but I think it can receive an action
about the merge of a PR. Once merge, we execute the clean process ;-)

Yeah, understood. I was thinking of having the individual patch
authors create temporary GitHub repositories to push to. It'd be an
optional step; if you want to show people a preview of your PR, just
create a repository and push to it (using a script something like
that). That way, you don't have to worry about malicious content
(since it'll be hosted under the author's name - I'm sure GitHub have
measures in place to deal with that, and it wouldn't be Python.org's
problem), nor having lots of gh-pages branches sitting around (they'd
be the responsibility of the author).

> But thank you for your idea.

No probs, and I don't mind if it's not adopted. Just wanted to put it out there.

The content will be generated by the build/html directory from Travis.
If Travis is green we upload the doc, if Travis is red, we do not
publish it. If there is an abuse, we close/drop the PR, maybe Bedevere
can receive this notification via the webhooks and notify the server to
remove the doc.

Currently, we use Travis. The malicious code will be execute in the
container of Travis, not on the server. We only copy the static files
and if we use nginx/apache, we don't execute the .py files. Just serve
the .html,.css,.js files

If I am making doc patches, shouldn't I be doing that *before* I 
submit the PR? How else will I know that my changes haven't broken the 
docs?

So surely I need to learn those steps regardless?

(Not a rhetorical question.)

Sure. But the usefulness has to be weighed against the extra complexity, 
the extra "one more thing that can break and needs to be maintained", 
and the risk of abuse.

I have no opinion on whether the pluses outweigh the minuses.

In fact, I was interested by your solution because we avoid the
maintenance of the server, but in our case, we would host many
Docs/build/html.

So one can build an HTTP server that gathers doc builds from Azure and expose them?

I think the intent is just uploading the output HTML and static assets.

I agree having the temporary output of PR docs build is useful, but I don't
think a python.org domain is necessary. If it can be uploaded to any cloud
storage service then that's good enough, just provide the link in the
status check. The output can be cleared after it receive the PR closed
webhook.

This will make review turnout quicker, since I can potentially review and
view the output from anywhere (phone while on a beach) instead of waiting
until I'm back home, open a computer, and then verify the output myself.

Either that, or Azure can push it directly to the server. (This way is 
simpler, since the processing power is already there and the trigger is 
trivial, compared to triggering yet another service from the build 
completion. Though it does mean putting credentials somewhere, which is 
why a github repo is the easiest option, as those are already there.)

Cheers,
Steve

And I think Bedevere is the best candidate for this feature (once
closed, remove from the server)

Doesn't read the docs already do this for pull requests?  Even if it doesn't, don't the core maintainers of read the docs go to pycon?  I wouldn't suggest read the docs for primary docs hosting for python, but they are perfectly fine for live testing pull request documentation without having to roll our own.

Yep, last week I was at a dinner at PyCon.DE, I have seen a PR, I wanted
to check the result and approve it or not. With this feature, I can
check it asap and just approve via github. Once approved, miss-islington
could merge the PR, once merged, Bedevere can notify the service and
remove the documentation of this PR.

To address one point, there's no need to run a web server to review the docs.  The generated docs can be viewed directly by any modern web browser by opening one of the files in the web browser's file menu.  Or perhaps easier, you can click on any of the generated html files; or on macOS you can use the open(1) command from the shell to open and view in the default web browser.

$ open build/html/index.html

There is an open request for this on GH, but it's not currently done:
https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1340

At the PyCon US sprints this year, we added documentation previews via
netlify, and they have been super useful:
https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/1367 My understanding is that
other projects do something similar with CircleCI.

It's not amazingly /difficult/ for reviewers to fetch the submitter's
branch, build the documentation and review it locally, but it's a decent
number of extra steps for what /should/ be a very simple review. I think
we all know that reviewer time and effort is one of the biggest
bottlenecks in the CPython development workflow, and this could make it
/much/ easier to do reviews.

Some of the concerns about increasing the surface area I think are a bit
overblown. I haven't seen any problems yet in the projects that do this,
and I don't think it lends itself to abuse particularly
well.//Considering that the rest of the CI suite lets you run arbitrary
code on many platforms, I don't think it's particularly more dangerous
to allow people to generate ephemeral static hosted web sites as well.


Best.

Oh, sorry if I misunderstood the concern. Yes, I agree that putting this
under python.org would not be a good idea.

Either hosting it on a hosting provider like netlify (or azure if that's
possible) or a dedicated domain that could be created for the purpose
(e.g. python-doc-ci.org) would be best. Alternatively, the domain could
be skipped entirely and the github hooks could link directly to
documentation by machine IP (though I suspect buying a domain for this
purpose would be a lot easier than coordinating what's necessary to make
direct links to a machine IP reasonable).


Best,
Paul

Ned, I agree with you about this point, but there is an advantage when
you use localhost:8000, you only have one entrypoint. And when you
switch between many PR, you just have to execute the make -C Doc/ serve
command (because in my workflow and with the full URI, the path can
change in function of the PR, I use git worktree for each PR).

But yep, I am +1 for firefox build/html/index.html

Yet you need to let Travis CI know how to upload the results (HTML 
files) somewhere. That usually involves some kind of credentials.
You can secretly tell Travis the credentials, however somebody would be 
able to modify the Makefile (or anything else) to send the credentials 
to their webservice/e-mail/whatever.
That is in fact not possible, for exactly this reason: Travis CI builds 
from PRs don't see the "secret" stuff.

You may or may not be right, but have you looked for problems or just 
assumed that because nobody has brought any to your attention, they 
don't exist?

"I have seen nothing" != "there is nothing to see".

Sorry Ned, I don't follow you here. It sounds like you're saying that 
you're fine with spam or abusive content being hosted in our name, so 
long as its hosted by somebody else, rather than by us (python.org) 
ourselves.

I trust I'm missing something, but I don't know what it is.

Does Github show a preview? If not, then my question still stands: how 
do I know my changes aren't broken?

If Github does show a preview, then couldn't the reviewer look at that 
too?

I can only speak from my experience with setuptools, but I do look at
every setuptools PR and I've never seen anything even close to this.
That said, I have also never seen anyone using my Travis or Appveyor
instances to mine cryptocurrency, but I've been told that that happens.

In any case, I think the standard should not be "this never happens"
(otherwise you also can't run CI), but that it happens rarely enough
that it's not a major problem and that you can deal with it when it does
come up. Frankly, I think the much more likely target for these sorts of
attacks is small, mostly abandoned projects with very few followers. If
you post a spam site on some ephemeral domain via the CPython CI, it's
likely that hundreds of people will notice it just because it's a very
active project. You will be banned from the project for life and
probably reported to github nearly instantly. Likely you have much more
value for your time if you target some 1-star repo that set this up 2
years ago and is maintained by someone who hasn't committed to github in
over a year.

That said, big projects like CPython are probably more likely to attract
the troll version of this, where the point isn't to get away with
hosting some content or using the CI, but to annoy and disrupt the
project itself by wasting our resources chasing down spam or whatever. I
think if that isn't already happening with comment floods on the issue
tracker, GH threads and mailing lists, it's not especially /more/ likely
to happen because people can spin up a website with a PR.

I think there are two concerns - one is that the python.org domain is
generally (currently) used for official content. If people can put
arbitrary websites on there, presumably they can exploit whatever trust
people have put into this fact.

Another is that - and I am not a web expert here - I think that the
domain where content is hosted is used as a marker of trust between
different pages, and many applications will consider anything on
*.python.org to be first-party content from other *.python.org domains.?
I believe this is the reason why readthedocs moved all hosted
documentation from *.readthedocs.org to *.readthedocs.io. Similarly
user-submitted content on PyPI is usually hosted under the
pythonhosted.org domain, not pypi.org or pypi.python.org. You'll notice
that GH also hosts user content under a githubusercontent.org domain.

OpenStack does that on review.openstack.org PRs. If I recall correctly, the
CI produces files which are online on a static web server. Nothing crazy.
And it works. Old files are removed, I don't know when exactly.

I don't think that it matters where the static files are hosted.

I can confirm that this is what OpenStack does. Sometimes the build artifacts (logs, docs ...) are rotated in two weeks but this is more than enough to perform a review. If I remember well retention is based on disk space and not hardcoded to a number of days, which is great.

TBH, I don't really know how a human can check the docs if they cannot access them on a webserver.

I hope to see the same on python too, very useful.

It's actually trivially easy with the Python doc set because the docs were designed to also be downloadable and usable off-line.  That is, the same files html, js, css, and other resources that get built and loaded onto the website can also be just browsed directly from a file system, like:

firefox Doc/build/html/index.html

or, say, using the Open File command in Safari or whatever.  No web server is needed.

The docsets for the heads of each of the active branches are built and packaged nightly and downloadable from python.org:

https://docs.python.org/3/download.html

Also, archive copies of the docset at the time of each release is downloadable from here:

https://www.python.org/doc/versions/

There are built using the same Doc/Makefile found in the cpython repo branches and the resulting Doc/build/html directory contains the docset for that snapshot of the repo with every file in the proper location for the webbrowser to load directly.

Hi All,
As part of our scikit-learn development and our effort to provide better 
parallelism for python, we rely heavily on dynamic classes and functions 
pickling. For this
usage we use cloudpickle, but it suffers from performance issues due to 
its pure python implementation. After long discussions with Olivier 
Grisel and Thomas
Moreau, we ended up agreeing on the fact that the best solution for this 
problem would be to add those functionalities to the _pickle.c module.
I am already quite familiar with the C/Python API, and can dedicate a 
lot of my time in the next couple months to make this happen.

Serhiy, from this thread 
(https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152509.html), 
it seems that you already started implementing local classes pickling.
I would be happy to use this work as a starting point and build from it. 
What do you think?

Regards,

Pierre

Subject: [Python-Dev] What is the difference between Py_BUILD_CORE and
 Py_BUILD_CORE_BUILTIN?
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGFskgwBf-m5kL6EkP22+Z_51s4sPCcoH4=T2Wmfge=ZrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to cleanup the Python C API, especially strictly separate
the public C API, the stable C API (Py_LIMITED_API), and the internal
C API (Py_BUILD_CORE).

Move internal headers to Include/internal/ :
https://bugs.python.org/issue35081

Move !Py_LIMITED_API to Include/pycapi/:
https://bugs.python.org/issue35134

I tried to ensure that Py_BUILD_CORE is defined when including
pycore_xxx.h headers from Include/internal/, but the compilation of
the _json module fails. Modules/_json.c contains:

/* Core extension modules are built-in on some platforms (e.g. Windows). */
#ifdef Py_BUILD_CORE
#define Py_BUILD_CORE_BUILTIN
#undef Py_BUILD_CORE
#endif

I don't understand the difference between Py_BUILD_CORE and
Py_BUILD_CORE_BUILTIN defines. Do we need to have two different
defines? Can't we compile _json with Py_BUILD_CORE?

_json.c uses pycore_accu.h:

/*
 * A two-level accumulator of unicode objects that avoids both the overhead
 * of keeping a huge number of small separate objects, and the quadratic
 * behaviour of using a naive repeated concatenation scheme.
 */

Is it a problem of the visibility/scope of symbols in the python DLL on Windows?

FWIW, I'm still in favor of keeping the includes specific.  For me
personally it helps to narrow down dependencies, making the source
easier to follow.

The runtime state isn't all that different from the thread state or
the interpreter state.  It's simply broader in scope, much like the
interpreter state is broader in scope than the thread state.  That's
why I put it where I did.

This is more appropriate for python-list than for python-dev, which is
about the development OF Python. But your problem here is quite
simple:

>         cmd = "blkid -o export %s | grep 'TYPE' | cut -d"=" -f3" % (fs)

You're trying to use the same quotation mark inside the string and
outside it. That's not going to work. Try removing your inner quotes.

You may also want to consider using Python to do your searching and
cutting, rather than a shell pipeline. For more information on that,
ask on python-list; people will be very happy to help out.

Yep.  I added Py_BUILD_CORE_BUILTIN as a workaround for building on
Windows.  For extension modules on Windows there's a conflict between
Py_BUILD_CORE and some of the Windows symbols that get defined.  My
Windows build knowledge is pretty limited so that's about as far as I
can go. :)  Steve might be able to give you more info.

looking at
 cmd = "blkid -o export %s | grep 'TYPE' | cut -d"=" -f3" % (fs)*

It?s probably because you have ? characters that are inside ? characters and it can?t tell where the string ends. It looks like you are trying to do

cmd = "blkid -o export %s | grep 'TYPE' | cut -d?      =      " -f3" % (fs)*

which doesn?t make sense.  Try using triple quotes instead so it?s clear what string you are trying to use.

cmd = ?""blkid -o export %s | grep 'TYPE' | cut -d"=" -f3?"" % (fs)

You can try many other places for support, such as Stackoverflow,

but I expect most of them will tell you the same thing. You should try 
to give a *minimum* example of your problem, not your entire script. 
Start by reading here:

As for your SyntaxError, the problem is line 99:

The arrow ^ is pointing to the wrong equals sign, but simplifying the 
code and adding spaces makes it clear:

cmd = "spam" = "eggs"

gives the same error. Perhaps you mean == (equals) or perhaps the second 
assignment shouldn't be there at all?

in Python 3.6+ is correct. It seems to imply that if an object's __await__
method returns an iterator, the object is awaitable. However, just
returning an iterator doesn't seem to work with await in a coroutine or
with the asyncio selector loop's run_until_complete method.

If the awaitable is not a coroutine or future, it looks like we wrap it in
a coroutine using sub-generator delegation, and therefore have to have an
iterator that fits a very specific shape for the coroutine step process
that isn't documented anywhere I could find. Am I missing something?

If the definition of an awaitable is more than just an __await__ iterator,
we may need to expand the documentation as well as the abstract base class.

Here's what I tried in making a synchronous awaitable that resolves to the
int 42:
class MyAwaitable(Awaitable):
    def __await__(self):
        return iter((42,))
# RuntimeError: Task got bad yield: 42

class MyAwaitable(Awaitable):
    def __await__(self):
        yield 42
# RuntimeError: Task got bad yield: 42

class MyAwaitable(Awaitable):
    def __await__(self):
        return (i for i in (42,))
# RuntimeError: Task got bad yield: 42

class MyAwaitable(Awaitable):
    def __await__(self):
        return self
    def __next__(self):
        return 42
# RuntimeError: Task got bad yield: 42'''

class MyAwaitable(Awaitable):
    def __await__(self):
        return iter(asyncio.coroutine(lambda: 42)())
# TypeError: __await__() returned a coroutine

class MyAwaitable(Awaitable):
    def __await__(self):
        yield from asyncio.coroutine(lambda: 42)()
# None

class MyAwaitable(Awaitable):
    def __await__(self):
        return (yield from asyncio.coroutine(lambda: 42)())
# 42

async def await_things():
    print(await MyAwaitable())

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(await_things())

"Awaitable" is a language-level concept. To actually use awaitables,
you also need a coroutine runner library, and each library defines
additional restrictions on the awaitables it works with. So e.g. when
using asyncio as your coroutine runner, asyncio expects your
awaitables to follow particular rules about what values they yield,
what kinds of values they can handle being sent/thrown back in, etc.
Different async libraries use different rules here.

Asyncio's rules aren't documented, I guess because it's such a
low-level thing that anyone who really needs to know is expected to
read the source :-). (In particular asyncio/futures.py and
asyncio/tasks.py.) But it's basically: the object returned by
__await__ has to implement the generator interface (which is a
superset of the iterator interface), the objects yielded by your
iterator have to implement the Future interface, and then you're
resumed either by sending back None when the Future completes, or else
by having an exception thrown in.

Thanks for the thorough rundown, Nathaniel. I started to get an idea of the
required shape only by looking at CPython code like you suggest. I wanted
to create an awaitable compatible with asyncio and trio that could be
awaited more than once unlike a coroutine, and not runner-specific like a
Future or Deferred. Are coroutines the only common awaitable the various
async libraries are going to have for now?

I'll take Python documentation suggestions up with other channels.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Signalling NANs
Message-ID: <20181109110507.GK4071@ando.pearwood.info>

I'm trying to understand some unexpected behaviour with float NANs in 
Python 3.5.

Background: in IEEE-754 maths, NANs (Not A Number) come in two flavours, 
so called "quiet NANs" and "signalling NANs". By default, arithmetic 
operations on qnans return a qnan; operations on snans "signal", which 
in Python terms means raising an exception.

The original IEEE-754 standard didn't specify how to distinguish a qnan 
from a snan, but a de facto standard arose that bit 51 of the float was 
the "quiet bit", if it were set, the NAN was quiet.

For the purposes of this email, I'm going to assume that standard is in 
place, even though technically speaking it is platform-dependent.

According to my tests, it seems that we cannot create snans in Python. 
The float constructor doesn't recognise "snan", raising ValueError. Nor 
can we convert a Decimal snan into a float:

py> from decimal import Decimal
py> snan = Decimal('snan')
py> float(dsnan)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: cannot convert signaling NaN to float


But unexpectedly (to me at least), we apparently cannot even create a 
signalling NAN by casting 64 bits to a float. Here are the functions I 
use to do the cast:

from struct import pack, unpack

def cast_float2int(x):
    return unpack('<Q', pack('<d', x))[0]

def cast_int2float(i):
    return unpack('<d', pack('<Q', i))[0]



Here's a regular quiet NAN round-tripping, as expected:

py> x = cast_int2float(0x7ff8000000000001)
py> x
nan
py> hex(cast_float2int(x))
'0x7ff8000000000001'


So far so good. But now let me try with a signalling NAN:


py> x = cast_int2float(0x7ff0000000000001)
py> x
nan
py> hex(cast_float2int(x))
'0x7ff8000000000001'


So it seems that the "quiet" bit is automatically set, even when using 
the struct module, making it impossible to create snan floats.

Is this intended? If so, why?

Is this meant as a language feature?



Thanks in advance,


Steve

I got '0x7ff0000000000001'.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Experiment an opt-in new C API for Python? (leave
 current API unchanged)
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGGcuo_-fdJwrisGP6+h6CuNzcErSoacaQySEb5h4nOQEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The current C API of Python is both a strength and a weakness of the
Python ecosystem as a whole. It's a strength because it allows to
quickly reuse a huge number of existing libraries by writing a glue
for them. It made numpy possible and this project is a big sucess!
It's a weakness because of its cost on the maintenance, it prevents
optimizations, and more generally it prevents to experiment modifying
Python internals.

For example, CPython cannot use tagged pointers, because the existing
C API is heavily based on the ability to dereference a PyObject*
object and access directly members of objects (like PyTupleObject).
For example, Py_INCREF() modifies *directly* PyObject.ob_refcnt. It's
not possible neither to use a Python compiled in debug mode on C
extensions (compiled in release mode), because the ABI is different in
debug mode. As a consequence, nobody uses the debug mode, whereas it
is very helpful to develop C extensions and investigate bugs.

I also consider that the C API gives too much work to PyPy (for their
"cpyext" module). A better C API (not leaking implementation) details
would make PyPy more efficient (and simplify its implementation in the
long term, when the support for the old C API can be removed). For
example, PyList_GetItem(list, 0) currently converts all items of the
list to PyObject* in PyPy, it can waste memory if only the first item
of the list is needed. PyPy has much more efficient storage than an
array of PyObject* for lists.

I wrote a website to explain all these issues with much more details:

   https://pythoncapi.readthedocs.io/

I identified "bad APIs" like using borrowed references or giving
access to PyObject** (ex: PySequence_Fast_ITEMS).

I already wrote an (incomplete) implementation of a new C API which
doesn't leak implementation details:

   https://github.com/pythoncapi/pythoncapi

It uses an opt-in option (Py_NEWCAPI define -- I'm not sure about the
name) to get the new API. The current C API is unchanged.

Ah, important points. I don't want to touch the current C API nor make
it less efficient. And compatibility in both directions (current C API
<=> new C API) is very important for me. There is no such plan as
"Python 4" which would break the world and *force* everybody to
upgrade to the new C API, or stay to Python 3 forever. No. The new C
API must be an opt-in option, and current C API remains the default
and not be changed.

I have different ideas for the compatibility part, but I'm not sure of
what are the best options yet.

My short term for the new C API would be to ease the experimentation
of projects like tagged pointers. Currently, I have to maintain the
implementation of a new C API which is not really convenient.

--

Today I tried to abuse the Py_DEBUG define for the new C API, but it
seems to be a bad idea:

   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10435

A *new* define is needed to opt-in for the new C API.

While one can hope that this will be the only time the C API will be
revised, it may be better to number it instead of calling it "NEW". 20
years from now, it won't feel new anymore.

To hide all implementation details, I propose to stop using macros and
use function calls instead. For example, replace:

#define PyTuple_GET_ITEM(op, i) \
   (((PyTupleObject *)(op))->ob_item[i])

with:

# define PyTuple_GET_ITEM(op, i) PyTuple_GetItem(op, i)

With this change, C extensions using PyTuple_GET_ITEM() does no longer
dereference PyObject* nor access PyTupleObject.ob_item. For example,
PyPy doesn't have to convert all tuple items to PyObject, but only
create one PyObject for the requested item. Another example is that it
becomes possible to use a "CPython debug runtime" which checks at
runtime that the first argument is a tuple and that the index is
valid. For a longer explanation, see the idea of different "Python
runtimes":

   https://pythoncapi.readthedocs.io/runtimes.html

Replacing macros with function calls is only a first step. It doesn't
solve the problem of borrowed references for example.

Obviously, such change has a cost on performances. Sadly, I didn't run
a benchmark yet. At this point, I mostly care about correctness and
the feasibility of the whole project. I also hope that the new C API
will allow to implement new optimizations which cannot even be
imagined today, because of the backward compatibility. The question is
if the performance balance is positive or not at the all :-)
Hopefully, there is no urgency to take any decision at this point. The
whole project is experimental and can be cancelled anytime.

That's exactly why I dislike "New", it's like adding "Ex" or "2" to a
function name :-)

Well, before bikeshedding on the C define name, I would prefer to see
if the overall idea of trying to push code for the new C API in the
master branch is a good idea, or if it's too early and the experiment
must continue in a fork.

Doesn't this mean that you're just making the C API larger and more
complicated, rather than simplifying it? You cite some benefits
(tagged pointers, changing the layout of PyObject, making PyPy's life
easier), but I don't see how you can do any of those things so long as
the current C API remains supported.

Tagged pointers and changing the layout of PyObject can only be
experimented in a new different Python runtime which only supports C
extensions compiled with the new C API. Technically, it can be CPython
compiled with a different flag, as there is already python3-dbg (debug
mode, ./configure --with-pydebug) and python3 (release mode). Or it
can be CPython fork.

I don't propose to experiment tagged pointer or changing the layout of
PyObject in CPython. It may require too many changes and it's unclear
if it's worth it or not. I only propose to implement the least
controversial part of the new C API in the master branch, since
maintaining this new C API in a fork is painful.

I cannot promise that it will make PyPy's life easier. PyPy developers
already told me that they already implemented the support of the
current C API. The promise is that if you use the new C API, PyPy
should be more efficient, because it would have less things to
emulate. To be honest, I'm not sure at this point, I don't know PyPy
internals. I also know that PyPy developers always complain when we
*add new functions* to the C API, and there is a non-zero risk that I
would like to add new functions, since current ones have issues :-) I
am working with PyPy to involve them in the new C API.

Sometimes, code is easier to understand than a long explanation, so
here is a very simple example of modified function for the new C API:

https://bugs.python.org/issue35206
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10443/files

PyTuple_GET_ITEM() becomes a function call and the function
implementation checks arguments at runtime if compiled in debug mode.

Technically, the header file still uses a macro, to implicitly cast to
PyObject*, since currently the macro accepts any type, and the new C
API should not change that.

So is it fair to say that your plan is that CPython will always use
the current ("old") API internally, and the "new" API will be
essentially an abstraction layer, that's designed to let people write
C extensions that target the old API, while also being flexible enough
to target PyPy and other "new different Python runtimes"?

If so, then would it make more sense to develop this as an actual
separate abstraction layer? That would have the huge advantage that it
could be distributed and versioned separately from CPython, different
packages could use different versions of the abstraction layer, PyPy
isn't forced to immediately add a bunch of new APIs...

Rather than adding yet another pre-processor directive for this I would
suggest just adding a new header file that only has the new stable API.
For example it could just be "py.h" or "pyapi.h".  It would have all of the
definitions for the stable API.

While that would involve some duplication from the existing headers, I
don't think it would be such a big deal - the idea is the API won't change,
methods won't be removed, and occasionally new methods will get
added in a very thoughtful manner.  Having it be separate will force
thought and conversation about it.

It would also make it very easy to look and see what exactly is in the
stable API as well.  There's be a pretty flat list which can be consulted,
and hopefully it ends up not being super huge either.

BTW, thanks for continuing to push on this Victor, it seems like great
progress!
